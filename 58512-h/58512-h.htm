<span>“WHY DON’T YOU LAUGH?”</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">P</span>OLLY leaned back against the great oak, her eyes bent on David’s
face. She wondered&mdash;and wondered hard. If she could only fathom that
inscrutable expression!</p>

<p>The young man, stretched on the grass among the waving shadows, was
gazing across the valley to the hills in their soft afternoon veiling.
It was a June picture beautiful enough to hold the attention of any
one, yet it was plain that David’s thoughts were not on the landscape.</p>

<p>They had come out for a walk, which had led them miles to the south and
finally to the top of Chimney Hill, where they had stopped to rest.</p>

<p>At the start David had been talkative enough, in fact unusually merry;
then, from no discernible cause, his lips had shut gravely and Polly
had not been able to draw out more than monosyllables and short,
matter-of-fact sentences. As she watched the unreadable face she tried
to guess what the trouble might be. As in the old days before college,
her lover had his occasional jealous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> moods, and although they were
less frequent they grew more and more bitter. Still, during the happy
intervals Polly would coax herself to believe that they were past
forever. Now she thought over the route, bit by bit, trying to find
something which could have disturbed him. At last, baffled in her
endeavors, she ventured suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“David, why don’t you laugh?”</p>

<p>He turned instantly. “At what?”</p>

<p>“Anything&mdash;nothing,” she answered lightly. “You seemed to be weighing
some heavy matter.”</p>

<p>“No, I was only&mdash;” He halted, then went on without completing his
sentence. “I am going away to-morrow,” he announced.</p>

<p>Polly’s smile vanished in surprise.</p>

<p>“Where?” she asked with her usual eagerness. “Spitzbergen or the South
Pole?”</p>

<p>David did not appear to notice her pleasantry.</p>

<p>“To the Adirondacks,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Polly exclaimed. “Were you just making up your mind?”</p>

<p>David reddened. “N-no,” he denied; “but Converse invited me only a day
or two ago, and I didn’t decide at once.”</p>

<p>“Going with Child Converse?” queried Polly’s lips, while her thoughts
ran along, “Why didn’t he tell me sooner? We were together all
yesterday morning and this afternoon&mdash;never a word until now!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” David was saying, “he is going to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> me up to their camp. His
father and mother are in Seattle, you know.”</p>

<p>“M-h’m,” she bowed. “How long you going to stay?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He hasn’t set any time.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be great, won’t it?” Polly smiled in her friendliest way.</p>

<p>He nodded gravely, slipping abruptly into complaint.</p>

<p>“You do not like Converse. You have never taken the trouble to know
him.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes twinkled. “I certainly ought to adore him,” she said;
“it is the first time you ever wanted me to look at any boy except Your
Royal Highness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t understand!” sighed David.</p>

<p>“I am always wondering,” Polly went on, a tiny scowl wrinkling her
smooth forehead, “how it is that Converse happens to attract you.”</p>

<p>“He is a good fellow,” said David positively. “But he has no stock of
prittle-prattle.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t his lack of nonsense,” Polly smiled. “He is too pretty. That
combined with his name&mdash;but he can’t help either, poor boy! Anyway, he
looks like a nice baby&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Baby!” sniffed David.</p>

<p>“Well, he does. With his round face and rosy cheeks and curly
hair&mdash;honestly, I always want to take him on my knee and trot him.”</p>

<p>David laughed, though as if against his will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“There’s nothing of the baby about him,” he asserted, “and a fellow
can’t help his looks.”</p>

<p>Polly shook her head. “No,” she agreed. “If only he and his sister
could exchange faces! Maybe, after all, it is she that flavors my
opinion of him.”</p>

<p>“Marietta?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” She was making little jabs in the soft moss with her slender
forefinger, and a faint smile began to curve her lips.</p>

<p>“She is a brainy girl,” was the somewhat stiff response, “and she has
always been very pleasant to me.”</p>

<p>“She is brainy enough,” replied Polly; “the trouble is, she knows it
and she shows that she knows it.”</p>

<p>“If she did not know it, there would be nothing to know,” said David
severely.</p>

<p>Polly’s smile broadened. “I was thinking,” she resumed, “of what
Patricia said the other day. Marietta has just been elected president
of the Much Ado Club in place of Ruth Mansfield. You know the
Mansfields are going to live in California. Ruth has grown pretty
stout, and Marietta looks as if she would blow away. Somebody was
wondering if she could fill Ruth’s place, and Patricia said very
soberly, ‘I think she’ll wabble about a little.’ Wasn’t that bright?”</p>

<p>“Unkind,” he answered forbiddingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, David!” she sighed, “you are so matter-of-fact. You don’t like
Patty any better than ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
“There is not much of her to like,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“David Collins!”</p>

<p>“It is true.”</p>

<p>“Every one but you thinks she is lovely,” asserted Polly.</p>

<p>“Probably they don’t require depth.”</p>

<p>“Patricia isn’t shallow,” she retorted.</p>

<p>“It appears so to an outsider. Look at her and her gang!”</p>

<p>“Gang!&mdash;David!”</p>

<p>He gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“The truth is, Polly, seeing we are talking plainly, I don’t like the
girls with whom you are so popular&mdash;the girls that have made you their
queen. They&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Queen! What are you talking about, David?” Polly broke in without
ceremony. Her voice was scornful.</p>

<p>“Yes, queen,” reiterated the young man. “Only they rule you, not you
them.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like it because I said yesterday I hadn’t time to have a
flower garden,” accused Polly.</p>

<p>“No,” denied David, “I was thinking of something else. You have too
many clubs on your hands.”</p>

<p>“They don’t amount to much in the way of time,” returned Polly.</p>

<p>“They must be a great bore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
“No; they keep me out of a rut, put me in touch with everything.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” scorned David. “I am glad I don’t need a posse of chattering
girls to keep me up to date. Not a single club for me in vacation! Cut
them out, Polly, every one! Why not?”</p>

<p>The girl laughed. “What a queer fellow you are! I’ll write to you every
day if you wish,” she added with seeming irrelevance, remembering a
certain request when they had separated at the beginning of the last
college year.</p>

<p>David brightened perceptibly&mdash;until a sparkle of fun in her brown eyes
swiftly altered his expression.</p>

<p>“Yes, you will have as much as three minutes a day to give to me, won’t
you!” he flashed, a tinge of bitterness in his tone.</p>

<p>“No, truly, David, I am in earnest,” smiled Polly. “My clubs don’t
take up nearly as much of my time as you think. If you would join some
of them&mdash;the College, for instance&mdash;you would change your mind. You
stand outside and criticize; you don’t get the right viewpoint. Try it,
David! You won’t be sorry. I’ll propose your name at the next meeting.”</p>

<p>“No, you will not!” was the prompt reply. “Nice time to join, while I
am off in an Adirondack camp.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you are not going to stay all summer, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
“I may.”</p>

<p>Polly looked straight into the blue eyes opposite. “Do you mean it?”</p>

<p>He bowed gravely. “It is more than possible.” He pulled out his watch.
“Time we were on the march,” he said, springing to his feet.</p>

<p>The walk home was like many another walk. Polly tried to make talk,
with poor results. There were long silences, while she, watching her
companion’s face, longed with all her heart to read what was being
written behind those unreadable eyes. She felt a relief when the
hospital was sighted.</p>

<p>“You’ll be up in the morning, shan’t you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I think there will not be time,” David answered quietly. “Converse
wishes to make an early start. I would better say good-bye now.” He
took her hand in his strong grasp, held it a moment as if words were
not ready, then said calmly, “I hope you will have a pleasant summer.”</p>

<p>“Just as if I were some ordinary acquaintance he had met on the
street,” Polly told herself in the seclusion of her own room. “What
does ail him!”</p>

<h2><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<span>THE LETTER</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE City Hall clock struck twelve, and Polly Dudley was still awake.
The circumstances of the afternoon were passing before her. What David
had said and what she had said, when he had laughed and when he had
been silent, what they had seen on the way&mdash;it was all there in the
procession that had no end. Just now they were at the corner of Webster
Street, where it joined Clayton Avenue. An Italian boy with a push-cart
was on the cross-walk, and Polly and David waited to let him pass. A
young man was coming towards them, a handsome young man in a shining
car. Now he was lifting his hat with his usual splendid smile, the
smile that showed his gleaming, perfect teeth&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh!” Polly breathed suddenly, “that was it! Now I know! How could he
be so silly! But it was! It is always some such little thing.”</p>

<p>At last she had discovered the direct cause of her lover’s changed
mood. She remembered how brilliantly Russell Ely had smiled to her as
he passed, and then until this moment she had forgotten him altogether.
Didn’t David want her even to bow to any one! But Russell was a member
of the College Club! This explained everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> It seemed hours before
sleep came to halt the wearying thoughts.</p>

<p>Polly was called from breakfast to greet David.</p>

<p>“We are not going to start as early as I expected,” he said, “not
before nine. So I thought I would&mdash;just run up and say good-morning.”
He smiled in almost his own cordial way.</p>

<p>The girl beamed up at him. She never harbored a pique, and now she
began to chat as gayly as usual, in seeming forgetfulness of yesterday.</p>

<p>David, however, could not so lightly throw off the past. Recollections
lingered to hamper his actions and retard his tongue. But he let
his eyes rest upon Polly in gratification, laughing at her little
pleasantries, and finally enjoying the present quite as if nothing
in past or future could have any evil power for him. The parting was
vastly different from that of the day before.</p>

<p>After he had gone Polly ran upstairs humming a song. How glad she was
that he had come!</p>

<p>The days seemed long without David. Since they returned from college
they had been much together, and now she missed him. The Randolphs
were away, and Patricia and the rest could not quite fill the gap.
The ladies of June Holiday Home always welcomed her with delight, and
she called there occasionally; but their increased freedom of action
carried them out-of-doors more than formerly, and she was apt not to
find those at home whom she most wished to see. Then, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> the place
had never seemed just the same since her beloved “Nita” had left it
forever.</p>

<p>She was returning, one afternoon, from a shopping excursion with
Leonora, when she was overtaken by Russell Ely. He drove up to the
curb, and threw open the door of his car.</p>

<p>“Will you ride up the hill?” he asked.</p>

<p>In a moment she was whirling along the shady avenue, arranging her
bundles comfortably in her lap and listening to her companion’s bright
talk.</p>

<p>“This is a pleasant lift for me,” she said. “I have been round in the
shops ever since luncheon, and I am tired.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have dared to ask you if that guardsman of yours were in
town; but since the length of New England is between us I thought I
might venture.”</p>

<p>Polly laughed, and they talked on and on, until she noticed that they
had not turned at the corner nearest home.</p>

<p>“You don’t mind going a little farther, do you?” he asked. “I seldom
get a glimpse of you nowadays. What do you say to running up to
Castleboro Inn for some toast and tea? The air is just right for a
drive.”</p>

<p>But Polly refused, although the invitation became urgent; so the young
man reluctantly left her at the hospital entrance.</p>

<p>“What would David say?” raced through her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> head and would not stop.
“What would David say? What would David say?”</p>

<p>“He won’t know it!” Polly retorted. “And it’s all right if he should.”</p>

<p>“What would David say? What would David say?”</p>

<p>Polly went indoors and made herself ready for dinner.</p>

<p>“What would David say? What would David say?” accompanied her upstairs
and down, and even to the dining-room door. Once at the table in the
presence of her father and mother, the teasing voice vanished. Yet it
returned the minute she was alone, and kept up the vexing question
until it was finally lost in sleep.</p>

<p>Every morning came a letter from David, and Polly was invariably at the
door to take it from the carrier. Sometimes it was little more than a
note; but oftener it spread itself over page after page in familiar,
affectionate talk.</p>

<p>Two days after Russell Ely had brought her up the hill, an envelope
with David’s well-known superscription was put into Polly’s hand. At
first it seemed no more than the envelope itself, so thin it was. Then
Polly saw that a single sheet was inside.</p>

<p>“Guess he was in a hurry,” she told herself, as she hastened up to her
room.</p>

<p>She sat down by the broad window and noted the slight unevenness of the
address. David’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> chirography was a continual wonder to Polly, every
line, every curve, according to rule. To-day, however, the “P” was a
wee bit out of proportion, the “D” was slightly out of alignment, while
the name showed a trifling tendency to run downhill.</p>

<p>“Well!” she exclaimed under her breath, “what’s going to happen?” She
dwelt upon it with a smile. Then she took up her paper-cutter and ran
it under the flap.</p>

<p>Her fingers were growing eager, and with a happy flutter of heart she
pulled out the sheet.</p>

<p>As she started to read, her face held a smile, but instantly a stare
swept it away. Her eyes seemed to pierce the paper. They blazed with
something like anger.</p>

<p>“‘Appeal’!” she muttered scornfully, “‘appeal,’ indeed!”</p>

<p>The letter fluttered to the floor, her hands went up to her face, and
she began to cry.</p>

<p>“Oh, David! David!” she whispered, “how could you! It isn’t true! You
know it isn’t true!”</p>

<p>She sat there a long time. Then she picked up the sheet and read it
again. Her face grew hard and resentful.</p>

<p>“‘Smile of understanding’! He won’t want me to smile at all pretty
soon.” She sighed. “By next week he’ll be ‘appealing’ to me. He’ll be
sure to come back, if I keep still. He always does. I know David! I’ve
half a mind not to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> him when he does ‘appeal.’ Let him have a
taste of his own porridge.”</p>

<p>She went over the letter again, slowly, sentence by sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noi mb0"><span class="smcap">Miss Polly</span>: Since it is plainly evident that you desire
your freedom from the slender bonds that bind us together, I wish
to assure you that from this moment they are broken, and you
are free as if they had never been. To continue the relations
which have existed between us for the few years past would only
pile up wretchedness for us both, and it is best to annul them.
Many times I have foreseen this. On the day we took that walk to
Chimney Hill and I noted the smile of understanding which passed
between you and that darned Ely, I knew that sooner or later this
would come. Yesterday when I heard of your intimacy with the same
unbearable puppy, your rides alone with him as soon as I was out
of the way, convinced me that the time for the break has arrived.
You need not attempt any explanation or appeal. My mind is made
up forever. Nothing can change my decision.</p>

<p class="center mt0 mb0">Very truly yours</p>
<p class="center indent mt0 smcap">David Gresham Collins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“‘Slender bonds’!” she muttered. “I didn’t know that I was bound at
all, though I act as if I were. Of course, I’m ‘free,’ and I will be
free, too, David Collins! As if you must tell me so! I wish I’d gone
over to the Inn with Russell&mdash;I will next time he asks me. I won’t be
under David’s thumb any longer! To think of his making such a fuss
because I rode up with Russell&mdash;just rode up the hill with him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“But how did he hear of my being with him?” Polly questioned. “We
didn’t meet anybody&mdash;yes, Doris Gaylord was out on the veranda. She
may have seen me. I didn’t think so. Anything she knew, Marietta’d
know&mdash;that is sure. And by this time Marietta may be up there herself.”</p>

<p>She pondered the matter for some minutes, while alternately her face
flushed and paled.</p>

<p>“Could Marietta&mdash;?” She shut her lips with a contemptuous little
breath. “Let her!” she scorned. “I won’t follow David Collins’s lead.”</p>

<h2><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<span>DAVID MAKES A REQUEST</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE next morning Polly was at the door as usual when the letter-carrier
came. She could not have told why. Certainly she did not expect a
letter.</p>

<p>Mechanically she received the bunch of mail, mechanically she threw
off the envelopes and papers, one by one, on the hall table. Then she
stared. There was the familiar handwriting! The rest of the lot was
dropped in an unsorted pile, and upstairs she sped with the letter from
David. She locked her door and flew to the window-seat. This time she
did not pause to note the lines of the superscription. She tore open
the envelope with eager fingers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">My darling Polly</span>: I suppose before this you have
received that horrible letter that I wrote you when I was
grass-green with jealousy. Throw it in the fire right now! Don’t,
don’t ever read it again! I was an outrageous cad to write it,
anyhow. But when Marietta and Doris came up here with that
story, I was just beside myself. I dare say Doris put in plenty
of touches of her own. Do write that you are not angry with me!
Write the very next mail! It is unbelievable that I could send
you such a thing&mdash;</p>

<p>Just my luck! The mail-boy is here, and not another chance to
send to the office to-day! A longer letter to-morrow.</p>

<p class="mt0 mb0">Always your own <span class="indent smcap">David</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Polly read it over with a smile. Again, and the smile changed to a
sigh. Once more, and sorrow came into her eyes.</p>

<p>How like David! Mad with jealousy one day, and wild with penitence the
next! Why must it be so? Why couldn’t he trust her?</p>

<p>She drew a chair to her desk and made ready to write. Then she took out
the letter of yesterday and looked it over; she read again the one just
received; finally she dipped her pen in ink.</p>

<p>She wrote fast until she had filled a sheet. Pausing to read it
through, she crushed it in her hand, tossed it into the waste-basket,
and began another.</p>

<p>That went the way of the first, and a third was written. This appeared
to bring more satisfaction, for she read it a second time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear David</span>: Your two letters have made me take a long
look ahead, and in view of what I see there I have come to a
decision. There is no use in our going on as we have been going
for four or five years. I cannot bear it. I must live my life in
my own way&mdash;I must be free, I must be myself.</p>

<p>You would put me in fetters of your own making. Instead of
trusting me out in the world, you would keep me away from the
world. In fact, you would make me a prim, silent, cold somebody
else, whom in time you would cease to love because I should not
be worth loving.</p>

<p class="mb0">You do not trust me, no matter what I say. You know that I care
for you more than for anybody else. Many times I have told you
so; still, reiteration does no good, for you will not believe. I
see no way but for us to give up our plans for a future together.
Even friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> must trust each other, and marriage without
confidence means unhappiness for two.</p>

<p class="center mt0 mb0">Forever your friend</p>
<p class="center indent mt0 smcap">Polly May Dudley</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Polly expected, David resented the high stand she had taken, and
his prompt answer consisted of alternate phrases of reproach and
apology. His second letter, however, was milder in tone, gracefully
acknowledging his mistakes, and agreeing, if she would give him one
more chance, never again to cause her grief by any behavior such as he
had been guilty of in the past.</p>

<p>After long debates between head and heart, the latter won the fight,
and Polly wrote a letter which made David go gayly for a week.</p>

<p>Patricia’s father planned for her a birthday fête, ending with a dance,
at the Illingworth Cottage at Samoosic Point, some seven miles from
Fair Harbor. Invitations were sent out three days in advance, and Polly
looked forward to a pleasant outing.</p>

<p>On the evening before the birthday she went over to see Lilith Brooks.
Some arrangements were to be made for the next morning. She found
her friend ready for a walk, and the two girls strolled off in the
direction of green fields and fewer dwellings.</p>

<p>A car whizzed by, a roadster with yellow wheels. For months afterwards
a yellow-wheeled roadster gave Polly a start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
“Wh-why!” gasped Lilith, “that looks just like David!”</p>

<p>“It is,” said Polly quietly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know he was here.” Lilith’s voice still held its astonishment.</p>

<p>“It is news to me,” laughed Polly; but the laugh did not sound true.</p>

<p>“Who was the girl? Could you tell?”</p>

<p>“I think it was Marietta Converse.”</p>

<p>“It is queer,” Lilith went on, glancing sidewise at her companion. “Do
you suppose Marietta rode down from Camp Converse with him?”</p>

<p>Polly’s heart was repeating the same question. Then things began to
right themselves. If both Marietta and David had errands in town it was
only natural that they should come together.</p>

<p>When Polly returned home she found that David had been there.</p>

<p>“He said he would drive over to Lilith’s and bring you back,” said Mrs.
Dudley.</p>

<p>“I came the short way, cut across the Blanchards’ yard,” explained
Polly. “That’s why I didn’t meet him.”</p>

<p>“He seemed anxious to see you to-night, so he will probably be here
soon. He is going back early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Then he won’t stay for the party,” said Polly. “I thought maybe that
is what brought him down.”</p>

<p>She repeated this to David himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
“No,” he replied indifferently, “I don’t train with that crowd. Are you
going?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Polly answered.</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly. “With whom?” he asked.</p>

<p>“With two or three of the girls, Lilith Brooks, for one.”</p>

<p>“In whose car?”</p>

<p>“I believe Russell Ely is going to drive.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I might have known,” he commented stiffly.</p>

<p>Polly laughed. “No, you mightn’t,” she returned. “Philip Lee was
intending to take us, but they had unexpected company at home and their
car was needed. That is why we are going with Russell. I don’t see why
you can’t stay over and go with us.”</p>

<p>“Marietta wishes to return at once,” he said. “Besides, I don’t care
for that sort of thing. I wonder that you do.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I? They are all my friends. I am sure it will be very
pleasant.”</p>

<p>David nodded abstractedly. “There is something I wish to ask you,” he
said slowly, and waited.</p>

<p>“I am listening.”</p>

<p>“Will you promise to do it?”</p>

<p>“I make no promises in the dark,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“I should think you might do one little favor for me,” he complained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
“David, I am ready to do little things for you, or big things; but I
cannot say positively that I will do this special thing without knowing
what it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, then&mdash;will you, for my sake, stay away from that foolish party?”</p>

<p>A sudden flame in the girl’s eyes made David flinch.</p>

<p>“So that is why you came down from Camp Converse,” she said&mdash;“that!”
Her low voice was tense with scorn. “You have shown me
plainly&mdash;just&mdash;what&mdash;you are!”</p>

<p>With her first words she had sprung to her feet, and now she darted to
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Polly! Wait! Wait!” cried David, putting out a hand.</p>

<p>But she eluded him and was on the stairs before he could reach her.</p>

<p>“Polly! Polly!” he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer, and he heard the door of her room shut with a
click. It was quiet in the hall upstairs.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. Then he put on his hat in a bewildered way and
passed out into the street.</p>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span>THE BIRTHDAY FÊTE</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">P</span>OLLY awoke early. Her first feeling was one of vague depression. Then
her mind cleared, and she knew what had happened&mdash;it was all over
between her and David. And this was the day of the fête, the day which
she had anticipated with such pleasure! She had planned to write a full
account of it to her lover. Now&mdash;! Thoughts came fast, bringing only
pain. She sprang out of bed and began to dress.</p>

<p>Of course, she must go to Samoosic Point. If she stayed at home it
would cause too much talk. But how could she meet people with gayety,
when she longed to run away from everybody, to hide, to rest, to think!
She went down to breakfast with a forced smile, and managed to go
through the meal without evoking any inquiries. She did not wish to
tell even her father and mother any sooner than was needful.</p>

<p>By the time the car came she had in large measure regained her usual
composure, and she hoped nobody would guess that she was playing a part.</p>

<p>Arrived at the cottage all was gay with flags and flowers and festival
dress. Merry talk and laughter mingled with music from a hidden
orchestra, the wide, glittering waters of the harbor, the arch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
blue above, made one glad to be part of such gladness. It would have
been a sorrowing heart indeed that could hold to its grief amid such
surroundings.</p>

<p>Polly was young and she was human. She was at once drawn into the heart
of the festivities, until she nearly forgot that she had awakened that
morning in company with trouble.</p>

<p>One of a group of merrymakers, she was strolling down towards Cliff
Grove, when along the drive by the sea-wall came a trim motor car.
Polly’s breath seemed to stop&mdash;the driver was David Collins, the girl
at his side was Marietta Converse!</p>

<p>Several spied the pair and ran to head them off. Lilith Brooks, who
had Polly’s arm, glanced sidewise. Polly was white, and her eyes had a
look that made Lilith shrink. Yet she clung tightly to her friend, as
if she feared she was going to break away. Polly, however, to Lilith’s
astonishment, resumed her talk with the others and did not even glance
in the direction of the newcomers.</p>

<p>“Did you know David was here?”&mdash;“Have you seen Marietta Converse? She
came with him!”&mdash;“I thought they were both in the Adirondacks. When did
they come back?”&mdash;“Polly had better be looking after David! He has a
new girl!”&mdash;These, with many variations&mdash;all innocently for the most
part&mdash;were flung in Polly’s ears through the hours before luncheon. How
she met them she hardly knew; yet Lilith, loyal Lilith, reported to her
afterwards that nobody would have known but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> that she had planned the
surprising occurrence herself.</p>

<p>Polly dreaded the evening. During the day she had managed to keep as
far away from David as possible, and John Eustis had unconsciously
assisted her efforts by inviting her, with several others, to take
a sail to one of the neighboring islands. But now, as the sun was
dropping low, she wondered what disagreeable circumstances the dance
would bring. What predicaments might it not have in store! At first she
thought she would not dance at all. But directly she decided that such
a course would draw unpleasant attention her way, and David might think
that she was keeping out of the frolic for fear of him. She concluded
to give herself free rein rather than run the risk of such conjecture
on his part.</p>

<p>As daylight waned it was forced upon Polly’s notice that David was
holding himself somewhat apart from the general merrymaking.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he is going to mull out the evening,” she mused. “Anyway,
he shall have no opportunity to think that I am forlorn on his
account.” And she threw herself into the fun with a zest that left
little doubt in the minds of her friends that she was not grieving for
her lover, whatever might be the trouble between them.</p>

<p>The musicians gathered on the broad veranda, the young folks flocked
inside. Patricia and a New York guest led the dance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Once Polly and Russell Ely waltzed so close to David, who was standing
alone near a window, that Polly’s dress must have brushed him as she
passed.</p>

<p>“He looks as if he wanted to shoot somebody,” said Russell in an
undertone&mdash;“probably me,” he added with a tiny smile. “What’s the
matter with him, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Polly laughed, a little light laugh which she let do duty for an answer.</p>

<p>“I used to like David Collins,” Russell went on; “but lately, I can’t
understand him.... I thought I’d never tell you; but I believe I will.”</p>

<p>“What?” responded Polly.</p>

<p>“In a moment.”</p>

<p>The music stopped as the two neared an outside door. Russell led his
partner to a small balcony, and they sat down.</p>

<p>“It is what he said to me a few weeks ago,” he began at once, “and to
this hour I cannot think what could have called it out. We met on the
street, and he walked up to me and said in the most abrupt way, ‘Ely,
I’d rather you would steal money out of my pocket than to do as you are
doing!’&mdash;I replied, ‘What have I done?’&mdash;‘Done!’ he ejaculated, and
walked off scowling. I’d give a good deal to know what he meant.”</p>

<p>“David is peculiar,” sighed Polly.</p>

<p>“All of that,” he returned. “If you’ll excuse my saying it&mdash;I don’t
want to meddle or give advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> where it isn’t desired&mdash;I have told
myself more than once, ‘If Polly Dudley marries David Collins I am
afraid she will rue it.’ From my outlook he is not a man calculated
to make any woman happy, least of all one of your make-up. Forgive my
candor.” For the girl was silent.</p>

<p>A dark figure passed below the balcony, and as the light of a lantern
struck across his face they discerned the features of David.</p>

<p>“‘Speak of angels...’” quoted Russell with a soft laugh. “You are not
offended?”</p>

<p>“You are too old a friend to give offense in that way,” said Polly. “I
thank you.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t. Are you engaged for the next dance?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to me,” spoke up a voice outside.</p>

<p>Polly started. How much had he overheard?</p>

<p>The musicians began another waltz.</p>

<p>“I’d better get out of the way,” said Russell in Polly’s ear. “Sorry I
can’t have the pleasure&mdash;”</p>

<p>David Collins leaped the low rail. “Come, Polly!” he said.</p>

<p>The girl did not stir as Russell with a pleasant word passed inside.
She was thinking hard.</p>

<p>“Come!” reiterated David. His voice was stern as he laid his hand on
her arm. The motion was one of proprietorship.</p>

<p>“You take a good deal for granted,” spoke Polly at last. “Hadn’t you
better sit down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“Don’t be a fool! Come on!”</p>

<p>“Your implication sounds rather rude to my ears,” smiled Polly.</p>

<p>He paid no heed. “Are you coming or not?” he asked with a tinge of
impatience.</p>

<p>“Not,” answered Polly. “I am used to being asked, rather than
commanded.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” David scorned. “Do you want a scene?”</p>

<p>“No. I want to sit still. I am tired.” She sighed wearily.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so before?” pettishly. He took the chair that
Russell had vacated.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home,” he resumed. “You are as sick of all this as I am.”</p>

<p>“I am sick of the way you behave,” she returned. “You make me ashamed
of you.”</p>

<p>“That should be reversed,” observed David coldly.</p>

<p>A tiny smile puckered Polly’s lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, laugh!” he burst out. “It is what you have been doing all
day.”</p>

<p>Marietta and her partner whirled past the doorway.</p>

<p>Polly arose. “If we must talk in this fashion,” she responded, “we had
better find a more secluded spot.”</p>

<p>“I will take you home,” he decided, offering his arm.</p>

<p>Many glances followed them as they picked their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> way between the
dancers. Polly wore a mask of smiles. David looked straight ahead. So
they reached the front entrance.</p>

<p>“I will bring the car round,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not for me,” answered Polly softly. And she stepped outside.</p>

<p>“Are you refusing to go with me?” he questioned severely.</p>

<p>“We cannot talk here,” she demurred, and led the way to a seat under a
tree.</p>

<p>“Will you answer me?” he scowled.</p>

<p>“You brought Marietta down, and I think you had better take her home.”</p>

<p>“Oh! if that is all, I can come back for her. Or she can go along with
somebody else.”</p>

<p>“No,” Polly replied quietly, “that will not do. I’ll return as I came.”</p>

<p>“H’m! I might have known you would not miss going with Ely.”</p>

<p>Polly did not reply. “What do you wish to say to me?” she asked.</p>

<p>With a little growl of disapproval, he dropped to the seat beside her.</p>

<p>“If you won’t,” he began, “I suppose you won’t; and I want this
business disposed of. I am tired of our everlasting squabbling. Perhaps
a girl likes it&mdash;I don’t.”</p>

<p>Polly sat silent. She was resolved not to be brought into another
argument; she knew how little it would avail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
“Well?” spoke up David, after a moment of stillness.</p>

<p>Polly drummed lightly the arm of the bench.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say something?” David’s voice was a bit impatient.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“Not even an apology?” he asked in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t pose as a martyr!”</p>

<p>“I might,” she replied with a little bitter laugh. “To-day has given me
sufficient excuse for it.”</p>

<p>“To-day!” he echoed, “to-day! When I have accorded you full reign, and
let you do exactly as you pleased!”</p>

<p>She made no response, and he continued. “Do you think it meant no
self-sacrifice on my part to allow you to come to such a party in
company with another man? Is it nothing for me to let you run about
with other fellows? to let you dance with those men?”</p>

<p>Polly smiled.</p>

<p>“And you sit there and laugh!” he fumed.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, David! But it does sound funny. You talk about <em>letting</em>
me do this and that! As if you were my master! It is enough to make
anybody laugh.”</p>

<p>“So you think it is perfectly right, I suppose, for you to go round
with anybody and everybody, without reference to me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
“That was the agreement,” she replied.</p>

<p>“It was a one-sided agreement, anyway,” he grumbled. “It left me
nowhere.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid no agreement would stand,” Polly returned. “I only wish
you could see things from my viewpoint.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! You are on Don’t-Care-Hill. That’s your viewpoint! If I were
there, it wouldn’t make any difference to me what you did.”</p>

<p>“So you think I don’t care!” Polly shook her head with a queer little
smile. “But what is the use of going over all this again!” she cried.
“How came you to stay over for the fête?” She was sorry the instant the
words had crossed her lips fearing what it might lead to.</p>

<p>“Marietta wished it for one thing. And you don’t suppose I would allow
you to come down here without me, where I couldn’t keep an eye on
you&mdash;where&mdash;oh, darn it! I’m not going to let you go round with Ely and
his crowd&mdash;not if I can help myself!”</p>

<p>“Tell me about your trip down,” said Polly, ignoring his answer.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything to tell,” sulked David.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll get Russell to take me up to your camp some day,” said
Polly quietly. “I should like to see if there isn’t something on that
long road worth talking about.”</p>

<p>The young man’s face grew dark.</p>

<p>“You’d better try it!” he cried. “If you ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> do, you’ll see me when
you get there! And you’ll hear me, too!”</p>

<p>“Why should it be any worse for me to ride up there with him than it
was for you to drive down here with Marietta?”</p>

<p>For an instant David stared, a singular, astonished expression on his
face. Then it changed. “Oh! you’re jealous of Marietta, are you?” he
sneered.</p>

<p>“No, David,” she answered, “not a bit. But one looks to me about the
same as the other.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t. I was speaking of coming, and Marietta said she wanted
some things at the house, and I told her I would drive her down&mdash;just a
sort of business arrangement.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Polly, “I guess that’s a good name for it, just a
business arrangement.” She laughed again, a queer little laugh that
made David look at her in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>“You know I don’t care anything about Marietta Converse,” he said.</p>

<p>“And you know that I care nothing for Russell Ely,” returned Polly.</p>

<p>“Huh! Looks like it!” scorned David.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you that a thousand times. I am
tired of being doubted and watched. If you ever reach the point of
trusting me, I will&mdash;”</p>

<p>As she arose a little group of merry young folks came chattering down
the path. One girl spied Polly and David.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
“Oh, come on, you two!” she called. “We’re going for a row.”</p>

<p>They halted opposite.</p>

<p>“Give you just three seconds!” cried Clay Boynton, pulling out his
watch and striking a match.</p>

<p>Polly returned a light refusal, which started a string of remonstrances.</p>

<p>A boy laid hold of David; but he slipped the grasp and catching Polly’s
arm pulled her down beside him on the bench.</p>

<p>“Nice, refined crowd you train with!” he growled before they were well
out of hearing.</p>

<p>Polly attempted no apology, only drew away with a quiet good-night.</p>

<p>Without an answering word he let her go, a slim white figure, across
the lawn.</p>

<span>“I WILL TAKE CARE OF PARADISE WARD”</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the top floor of the Children’s House of Joy was the most beautiful
hospital ward in the whole world. When Mrs. Gresham was completing
her plans for the institution Polly Dudley was often called into
consultation, and it was decided to give the prettiest ward to
those children that were ill with incurable diseases. Mrs. Gresham
had ordered many appurtenances which Dr. Dudley called foolish
extravagance, but in which she and Polly reveled, anticipating the
delight of the little unfortunates for whom they were devised.</p>

<p>“What shall we call it when it is done?” Mrs. Gresham had said one day,
as she and Polly were overseeing the final touches to the wonderful
apartment.</p>

<p>“If I have my way,” Polly had declared, “it shan’t have one letter of
‘incurable’ in its name.”</p>

<p>“You can have your way,” Mrs. Gresham had asserted. “And you must hit
upon something soon, if I’m to get any sleep. Last night I lay awake
full three hours muddling my brain over it, and then I couldn’t think
of anything half pretty enough.”</p>

<p>“Something has just come to me!” Polly had cried; “but maybe you won’t
like it. What do you say to ‘Paradise Ward’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
At that Mrs. Gresham’s delicate hands had clapped the softest of
applause, and the ward was named.</p>

<p>Paradise Ward was indeed a marvel of beauty, from the fairy stories in
fresco upon the walls to the dainty little fountains that sent music
and perfume throughout the apartment. There were the cushioned rolling
chairs with the dearest little tables and pockets that held dolls and
toys and picture books of just the right size for frail little hands.
There were cages of charming love birds that never wearied one with
piercing songs. There were the little white-and-gold beds, with lilies
and roses at head and foot, blooms that never faded or grew limp with
age; there were small bookcases that one might whirl and whirl and
find the very book that was wanted; there was a glass-doored cupboard
that held the loveliest of little and middling-sized china plates
and cups and saucers, just big enough for small people to eat from,
and they had wreaths of pansies and sprays of checkerberries, for
one to look at while eating. Then, there were the dearest, littlest
dishes for the dollies, too, so that they could eat their dinners with
their mammas&mdash;oh, wonderful things could be found in those pretty
cupboards! Plants and vines grew and bloomed all over the big room,
and clocks!&mdash;such delightful clocks! In one lived a cuckoo that came
outside every half-hour, just long enough to tell its name. And there
was a bigger clock upon which perched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> an owl, and the owl would say,
“Tu-whoo!” or “Tu-whoo! whoo! whoo!” according to whether it was one
o’clock or three. And all the little folks that lived in Paradise Ward
knew it was the loveliest place in the world, for nobody ever told them
that the reason they were brought to so beautiful a home was because
they would never be well again as long as they lived.</p>

<p>Polly Dudley had not seen David or heard from him since the night of
Patricia’s birthday fête. That was eight days ago. It might as well
have been eight months or eight years&mdash;so Polly felt. She was weary
with the ache of it. She wondered for the thousandth time if she had
done right to leave him so abruptly. Perhaps she had been too harsh.
She could not decide, and as the days numbered more and more, her
sorrow and restlessness increased. Her father and mother were in hearty
accord with the stand she had taken, yet even their sanction did not
bring her peace.</p>

<p>So often before these dreary days had she dreamed of wide estrangement
between her and David, and had been thankful even to tears when she had
come to herself to find she had been only dreaming. But from this there
was no awakening.</p>

<p>Yet there were hours when it seemed as if the trouble must be unreal.
She and David drifting farther and farther apart never to meet again in
the old way! No, that could not be true!</p>

<p>To-night she sat alone in the living-room, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> reading; but
David kept obtruding himself into the story, so that it did not run
smoothly. Every little while the reader would sigh, and yet the tale
was supposed to be humorous. Finally she became aware of voices in the
room adjoining, a little room where Dr. Dudley went whenever he could
spare a few minutes’ time, to rest or to think over cases that troubled
him. At first she did not recognize the woman’s voice; then she knew
that it belonged to Miss French, one of the nurses.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do,” the nurse was saying. “I hoped
she could stay to-night; but her mother is so much worse that she was
just about crazy. She said she must go, and you can’t blame her.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to get somebody outside,” said Dr. Dudley.</p>

<p>“We can’t!” asserted Miss French. “There’s a shortage of nurses
everywhere, so many are off on vacations. I’ve telephoned and
telephoned&mdash;I didn’t want to bother you if I could help it&mdash;and Dr.
Macy told me to engage the best I could find; but there isn’t a soul to
be had.”</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Dudley were at home she would go in for to-night; but we’ll
get along somehow. They are all pretty well in there, that’s a good
thing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Paradise Ward is the easiest to handle,” assented the nurse.</p>

<p>Polly had been listening, listening closely, while red spots fluttered
in and out of her cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
“I will take care of Paradise Ward,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>Dr. Dudley and Miss French looked up to see Polly standing in the
doorway.</p>

<p>“That is,” she added, “if father thinks I am competent.” She had
appeared to be addressing the nurse; now her eyes met the physician’s.</p>

<p>“You are perfectly capable, as far as that goes; there is no acute
illness there. But you might not wake if you were needed.”</p>

<p>“Of course I should!” she declared. “I wake very easily.”</p>

<p>“You can try it. I dare say to-morrow we can find somebody.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready right away,” she told Miss French, and ran upstairs.</p>

<p>Polly opened softly the door of Paradise Ward. The dozen small
occupants were in bed, and a dim night-lamp was burning. The nurse
who had made ready for the night had flitted away to those that were
waiting for her. Polly did not think her entrance had awakened anybody;
but a small head was raised from its pillow, and a voice called out in
a low, delighted tone, “’Llo, Mi’ Duddy!”</p>

<p>The girl hastened across the room, to pat the mop of yellow hair and
to hush any tendency to talk. She was acquainted with little Marmaduke
Bill, and she knew the importance of cutting off his flow of prattle
before it became an uncontrollable stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
“So long you didn’ come, Mi’ Duddy, My thought My should die.”</p>

<p>Polly smiled down on him, and said softly, “Now you will go to sleep,
for I shall be right here all night.”</p>

<p>A little hand was reached out, to stroke Polly’s. “My’s glad, My’s very
glad, Mi’ Duddy.” And he shut his eyes in content.</p>

<p>Polly was a frequent visitor in Paradise Ward, and “Little Duke” was as
beloved by her as by Dr. Dudley himself.</p>

<p>Few of the small patients needed much attention that night from their
new nurse; still, Polly really slept but little. The novelty of her
position as well as plans for the near future pushed sleep into the
background and kept it there.</p>

<p>The next day nurses were as scarce as on the night previous, and
Polly, signifying her willingness to remain in Paradise Ward, was
gladly allowed to stay. But when a trained assistant was to be had,
and Polly begged not to be turned out, Dr. Dudley remonstrated against
the confinement, maintaining that by September Polly would be in no
condition to return to college. The girl, however, insisted that the
light work was just what she needed to keep her mind busy with outside
thoughts, and finally she had things her own way. Her father and mother
could see plainly enough that she was lighter-hearted than she had been
since her separation from David, and her patients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> all agreed with
Little Duke, who told Polly very solemnly “Mi’ Duddy, if you go away,
My shall feel rot-ting!”</p>

<p>So Polly did not go. Instead, she began at once to carry out some of
the many ideas that had come to her since her installment in Paradise
Ward. Polly was as observing now as she had been in her childhood, and
a day had not gone by before she was planning little new things for the
supposedly perfect ward. She was aware that she had only to hint of
these to Mrs. Gresham to have them there at once; but she did not wish
to apply to the founder of the hospital. So when she could get somebody
to take her place for an hour or two she would go off on shopping trips
and come home with all sorts of accessories for the ward. First she
brought a new hair-ribbon for Clementina Cunio, a bright pink ribbon to
replace the one of dingy brown. And the child’s delight repaid Polly in
full for the small expenditure of pocket-money. But that small purchase
set in motion a chain of wishes which Polly feared for a time was to
be a chain after the style of the usual ten-cent concatenations. When
William Moleski saw the pink bow sitting so jauntily on Clementina’s
head, he was instantly seized with a desire for a tie of like color for
his neck. Then Timmy Dennis began to long for a similar adornment to
tie around the collar of his little striped nightgown. The color had
taken the ward by storm, for one after another expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> a wish, more
or less boldly, for some ornament of the same hue. The young nurse was
mildly surprised when Annette Lacouchière asked for a pink dress; but
her astonishment reached its height at the observation of Little Duke.</p>

<p>“Mi’ Duddy, My’s good boy. My won’t cry ever when My is inside o’ pink
all over!”</p>

<p>Polly brought home other and apparently more useful articles than pink
ribbons. One day it was some pretty boxes of tiny sheets of note-paper,
with so many little envelopes, in the same delicate tint, that one
might spoil two or three and still have enough left.</p>

<p>At another time her purchases were two little washtubs, each big enough
to hold a dolly’s frock, and&mdash;most charming of all&mdash;two little electric
flatirons to make the dainty wardrobes smooth and beautiful. These had
been suggested by Zulette Mardee’s sighing statement to her next-chair
neighbor, that her beloved Theodora hadn’t “a single clean dress to her
name,” and that nothing would make her so happy as to put them into
the washtub. Grissel, the neighbor, had agreed with her perfectly,
whereupon the succeeding day both little girls were in soapsuds up to
their elbows, their small tables wet from end to end and spilling over,
and their faces joyous as a June morning.</p>

<p>“You are making yourself a lot of work,” commented a young nurse to
Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“A lot of pleasure, you mean, don’t you?” returned the Doctor’s
daughter.</p>

<p>Miss Bartlett shrugged her small shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a week to find out,” she laughed.</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span>“MAYBE”</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE tiny girl sat in her pillowed chair by the window while the lady
from the next street talked with Aunt Sophie. Mrs. Hamilton Garde
wanted Aunt Sophie to go over to the great house where she lived and
clean some walls and floors. Now they were haggling over the price, or,
rather, Mrs. Hamilton Garde was haggling. The plump little woman who
scrubbed for her neighbors never haggled. She quietly stated her price
by the day or by the hour and let her patron talk. To-day the patron,
being Mrs. Hamilton Garde, had argued and hinted and argued again for
full seventeen minutes, and finally decided that even if twenty cents
an hour was an unreasonably high price to pay, the work must be done
and she should not feel justified in hiring somebody outside of the
neighborhood. So she bade the little plump woman with red, big-jointed
hands “to be sure and get over there and ready to work right on the
notch”&mdash;which meant seven o’clock on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Long before this, the child had tired of the uninteresting talk,
especially as she had heard the same thing many times over which always
ended in the very same fashion. She was looking out of the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> when
Mrs. Hamilton Garde passed her on the way out. The baby-blue eyes were
dwelling on the big, shining car in front of the little house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton Garde noted the earnest look, and she asked sweetly:</p>

<p>“Are you fond of motoring?”</p>

<p>“Motoring?” repeated the little girl in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hamilton Garde laughed in silvery tones, and simplified her
question.</p>

<p>“Do you like automobile riding?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the small voice. “No, ma’am&mdash;I mean, I guess I should. I
never did, you know.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” laughed the woman. “Well, I’ll take you some
day&mdash;to-morrow, maybe. Good afternoon, Mrs. Edmonson. Be sure and come
early. Seven o’clock sharp on Thursday!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Sophie!” the little girl burst out as soon as the door
closed, “did you hear what she said? She’s going to take me to ride!
Just think, to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Maybe!” added Aunt Sophie.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess she will!” cried the little one, her wee face aflame with
joy. “She <em>promised</em>, you know, and everybody always does just what
they <em>promise</em>. I’ve heard Sardis say lots of times that he’d got to do
something, because he’d <em>promised</em>. What time do you s’pose we’ll go?
As early as this?”</p>

<p>The little woman’s lips opened&mdash;and shut. She waited. “I’m sure I don’t
know,” she said at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
“I wish you were going, too,” the child said wistfully; but Aunt Sophie
was silent. The doubt in her kind heart did not reach the wee girl at
all. When Aunt Sophie looked at the happy face and sighed, the child
was gazing far away into to-morrow afternoon, seeing herself seated
among those beautiful, soft cushions and whirling off down the street;
whirling away, uphill and down, and out into the land of flowering
fields and gay gardens, wide blue lakes and high green hills, running
brooks that sang as they went, and deep ravines filled with ferns that
never saw the sunshine; whirling on and on to those wonderful delights
of which she had seen so little and which Brother Sardis had promised
should be hers as soon as she went to live with him. And now it was
all coming to-morrow! She ate her supper that night to the whirring of
cars, the blare of motor horns, and&mdash;yes, the odor of gasoline. She
talked about it, too, as she ate, and never noticed that Aunt Sophie
was more than ordinarily silent.</p>

<p>Next morning, as soon as she awoke, the tiny girl found herself in
a strange state of excitement, and contrary to her usual custom she
called Aunt Sophie to her bedside.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better dress me right away, so I’ll be all ready to go when
Mrs. Garde comes?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be afraid of her getting here before your breakfast,”
laughed Mrs. Edmonson grimly. “She don’t have hers till ten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“Oh!” exclaimed the little one, “are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I ought to know,” the woman replied. “I’ve been there often enough and
heard Tilly and Sadie scolding because the breakfast was all dried up
waiting for her.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” the child smilingly insisted, “it would save trouble to put
on my best clothes now, and then I shouldn’t have to make her wait, no
matter when she comes.”</p>

<p>“You’re a queer young one to get around things,” Aunt Sophie laughed.
Then she brought out a little striped pink gingham frock, snowy
white petticoats, and a pair of shiny black shoes none too large
for a two-year-old baby, while the little girl in bed watched the
preparations with smiles of approval.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t set your heart on going this afternoon,” Aunt Sophie
finally advised. “To my mind it is very uncertain whether she
comes”&mdash;there was a perceptible pause&mdash;“to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I s’pose it will be just as nice if she shouldn’t come till
to-morrow,” the child reflected, “’cause then I shall have it longer
to think about. You see, one day doesn’t make much difference,” she
philosophized. “Yesterday it seemed a perfect age till to-day, and now
it’s right here in no time at all. I guess it’s always that way. So if
she doesn’t have time to come to-day, I shall know to-morrow will be
here in just a few minutes. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> guess she’ll come&mdash;I kind o’ feel
it! Don’t you ever feel things coming, Aunt Sophie?”</p>

<p>The plump little aunt bobbed her head with a “M-h’m” over the drawer
where the small girl’s stockings were kept.</p>

<p>The little one chattered on until she was seated in her high, cushioned
chair at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“Now you’d better let your victuals stop your mouth,” laughed her aunt,
not unkindly. “If you don’t keep still, pretty soon you won’t be fit to
go to ride or anywhere else. You’ve talked every minute since you woke
up.”</p>

<p>The child pressed a forefinger to her smiling lips, while she looked
across the table in merry response.</p>

<p>Morning usually slipped swiftly away with the elder member of the
household, but dragged more or less wearily with the little one who had
nothing to do but to sit at the window and gaze across the street and
up at the lawns and gardens that surrounded the home of Mrs. Hamilton
Garde on Burton Avenue. She could catch glimpses of the great house,
with its towers and multi-colored roofs, as the green branches waved to
and fro. The stables and garage were at the foot of the hill, almost
directly opposite the little gray house, and a path led down from the
mansion above. Few trod this path except the stable boys, the coachman
that drove the handsome pair of black horses, and the two chauffeurs
who had charge of the shining cars.</p>

<p>The watcher at the small window never tired of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> looking at those
beautiful cars when they came out of the garage, and they generally did
come out two or three times a day.</p>

<p>This morning there was no weariness in the baby-blue eyes as they
watched for one of the chauffeurs to come down the path. Of course,
the little maid told herself, Mrs. Hamilton Garde would not come for
her until afternoon&mdash;she wondered whether it would be at one or two or
three o’clock. Anyway, she was ready, all ready except for the putting
on of her coat and hat. She drew a sigh of satisfaction. It was so
comfortable to know that one was ready for whatever came. Then she fell
to thinking of the happy letter she would write to Sardis, dear Brother
Sardis, about the wonderful ride that Mrs. Hamilton Garde had given
her. Brother Sardis never spoke of Mrs. Hamilton Garde these days. But
she could remember a time, long ago,&mdash;she was such a mite of a girl
then,&mdash;before Sardis went to live with Uncle Dwight, when he used to
hate the rich woman who lived in the great house on Burton Avenue,
because of the way she had of tossing her head with a gay little laugh
whenever she chanced to come upon him with his sister in his arms.
As she thought it over now, she wondered why Mrs. Garde had laughed.
She was sure it was a very nice thing for Sardis to do, nothing at
all funny about it as far as she could see. Sometimes she knew that
he had stayed away from a ball game just to carry her out for a long
walk. Perhaps she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> did look funny in his arms, for Sardis was rather
small for his age. Once&mdash;she should never forget it!&mdash;Mrs. Garde had
said, “So you’re taking out your doll for an airing!” And then she had
laughed that gay little laugh. Sardis had watched the carriage into the
distance with a dark, scowly face. He had said something, too, under
his breath that she could not hear, and when she had asked him what it
was his face had grown very red and he would not tell. Dear Brother
Sardis! How she wished she could see him this very minute! As soon
as she had had her ride she would write to him all about it, and how
surprised he would be!</p>

<p>The sight of the tallest chauffeur coming down the path put a stop to
her musings, and she watched him as he disappeared in the garage. He
generally drove the big car. “Oh, I hope it will be the big car this
afternoon!” she said to herself. It was the big car now, for the tall
young fellow drove it from the garage and then stopped, jumped out and
ran back for something. He drove directly by the window and up the road
to the great house. Mrs. Hamilton Garde was going to ride. The little
girl drew a long, happy breath&mdash;it was nice to have so beautiful a
thing to anticipate.</p>

<p>“Maybe she’ll come right after luncheon,” smiled the wee maid two hours
later from her high chair;&mdash;“you said she didn’t have dinner at twelve,
as we do.” She looked across to her aunt for reassurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
“She has hers at six,” answered Aunt Sophie.</p>

<p>“Maybe she’ll come at two o’clock,” the little one prattled on. “Don’t
you guess it will be about two?”</p>

<p>A quick shade passed over Aunt Sophie’s round face. Then a smile came
out.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” she said.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it perfectly beautiful that I’m going?” the child went on.
“There’d be room for you,” she observed wistfully. “Won’t you go if she
asks you?”</p>

<p>“No danger of an invitation,” with a short little laugh. Seeing the
reflection of her own shadowy thoughts on the small face opposite, she
added quickly:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I couldn’t go, anyway; I have too much work on hand to go gallivanting
off across the country.”</p>

<p>“Too bad you can’t,” was the plaintive regret. “When Sardis gets his
car you’ll have to go.”</p>

<p>Aunt Sophie nodded smilingly. “Oh, yes, I’ll go when Sardis has his
car.”</p>

<p>“He says he’s going to have one some day,” returned the child, wagging
her small head emphatically.</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt he will,” said Aunt Sophie. “He’s got a good many things
I never would have believed he’d have. He’s the greatest boy for
carrying out whatever he starts on. If he should happen to want to be
President, I declare, I d’n’ know but he’d get there.”</p>

<p>The little flower face shone, as it always did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> when “Brother Sardis”
was being praised. For the moment Mrs. Hamilton Garde was utterly
forgotten.</p>

<p>Two o’clock came, from the old-fashioned clock on the kitchen shelf
sounded two heavy strokes, the little girl at the window feverishly
watched the path that led down to the garage; but nobody appeared.</p>

<p>“I guess she’s taking a nap,” were the unspoken words that tried to
chase away a wee doubt which for a good many minutes had been pressing
its way into the hopeful little heart. “Of course, she’d take a nap
before going out again!”</p>

<p>Whether there was a nap or not, neither of the chauffeurs came into
sight. Half past two&mdash;three&mdash;half-past three&mdash;four&mdash;all ticked
themselves away on the old clock. It was very quiet in the front room
of the little gray house. The light haze that brooded over the hills
seemed also to have veiled the blue eyes at the window. Still, they
kept loyal watch.</p>

<p>By and by the child suddenly straightened&mdash;the tall young chauffeur
was striding down to the garage! It seemed as if the blue eyes must
pierce the side of the low building, so eager were they to see inside.
Presently the big automobile came out and whizzed past the window.</p>

<p>“Aunt Sophie! Aunt Sophie!” cried the little one joyously, “do come and
put on my things! She’ll be here in a minute! The man’s gone round!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
The little plump woman ran in breezily. “What is it, dear?”</p>

<p>“Please bring my things. I don’t want to make her wait. There! they’re
coming!”</p>

<p>“No, no, child! That’s only the undertaker.”</p>

<p>“Well, she will be here right off. Do hurry, auntie! The man just went
round to get her!” The child leaned forward, to catch the first glimpse
of the returning car.</p>

<p>Aunt Sophie stood&mdash;unmoved as to feet.</p>

<p>“Better wait,” she said, “till she comes.”</p>

<p>The little one turned to look up into her aunt’s face, and her
eagerness nearly faltered.</p>

<p>“Why, you don’t want to make her you?” she asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess her time isn’t over valuable,” she said slowly. “Anyway,
I wouldn’t put on my things yet.”</p>

<p>They waited, the one all a-quiver with anticipation, the other gazing,
not down the street, but at the child, her round, usually placid face
now lengthened by lines of tenderness and pain.</p>

<p>The automobile did not come back. Finally Aunt Sophie crept quietly
away to the kitchen, where she could not see the little white face by
the window. The child was still scanning the road hopefully when, just
before six o’clock, the big car returned to the garage, empty except
for the liveried driver.</p>

<p>Aunt Sophie entered the room in her preparations for tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
“She didn’t come,” needlessly announced the small voice. “I guess she
thought she’d wait till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The little woman sighed softly.</p>

<p>“I think she’ll come to-morrow,” went on the voice in cheerful tone.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” returned Aunt Sophie.</p>

<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span>GLADYS GUINEVERE</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE sun was radiant; the sky wore a most alluring blue dress; the
breeze was sending up little velvety waves and ripples from the
south;&mdash;Polly wanted Outdoors. As she gazed from the open window she
grew eager. Her mother happened in and proposed to stay awhile and give
Polly a chance.</p>

<p>The girl looked around the ward, and considered. There was
Timmy&mdash;Jozy&mdash;She hesitated at Clementina and finally shook her
head with a sad little frown. Her eyes passed to Grissel, and
brightened&mdash;Timmy and Jozy and Grissel. That was enough.</p>

<p>She glanced across at her mother who was giving Little Duke a drink.</p>

<p>“Is father away?” she asked.</p>

<p>Learning that he was in the hospital, she went in search of him.</p>

<p>“Would Timmy and Grissel and Jozy be any worse for a little ride?” she
questioned, her anxious eyes on her father’s face.</p>

<p>In a moment she was running up the stairs, stopping only for a word
with an orderly. When she entered Paradise Ward her face was as bright
as if she had just been made heir to a fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
For the next ten minutes she and her mother were busy bringing out
coats and hats and putting the three fortunate little patients into
their wraps.</p>

<p>“Are we going to sit on the veranda now?” queried Jozy.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Dudley only smiled mysteriously. It would never do to tell
too much to the part of the ward that must stay at home&mdash;there might
be tears. But, as two orderlies carried the lucky ones out through the
corridor and downstairs, those who were left behind knew that something
unusual was afoot. If Clementina and the rest could have looked round
the corner of the building they would have seen the three packed snugly
into the Doctor’s big, easy car, to the music of gurgling laughter and
silver-toned tongues.</p>

<p>Straight to the blossoming fields and piney air they were borne, and
the children chattered and giggled as only children can, while Polly
drew in deep draughts of the freshness of mountain and wood, and
wondered how the dwellers in city prisons ever lived through the summer
at all.</p>

<p>Nearing a neighboring town, their road led through a street bordered
with miserable dwellings and swarming with sinister men and women and
ragged, pinched-faced children. Polly looked at them with pity.</p>

<p>The car swerved suddenly, to avoid a crossing team, and Jozy uttered a
wild “Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Polly glanced back at her charges with a reassuring smile.</p>

<p>“My handkerchief!” screamed Jozy, pointing to the little square of
white that had fluttered away from her.</p>

<p>But already an eagle-eyed youngster had pounced upon the flyaway. With
a joyful grin she brought it to the car.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you!” cried the owner in a relieved voice.</p>

<p>Evan was starting up again when Polly arrested him. “Just a minute!”
she said. Something in the girl’s wistful little face attracted her.</p>

<p>“Would you like a ride?” she asked, throwing open the door.</p>

<p>The black eyes widened. The child drew a step nearer, then stopped with
a dazed expression. She must have been mistaken!</p>

<p>“Will you come?” Polly held out her hand.</p>

<p>Nothing further was needed. In a short moment the little one was wedged
between Polly and Evan, her face radiant with pleasure.</p>

<p>Wonder-eyed youngsters popped out from everywhere and closed in about
the car.</p>

<p>The driver waved them off, there was a bur-r-r-r-r, and the automobile
disappeared around the next corner.</p>

<p>“It’s ezac’ly like flyin’, ain’t it?” piped a rapturous voice at
Polly’s elbow.</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” smiled Polly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
The child looked up with an ecstatic wag of the head.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she burst out, leaning forward and waving her hand excitedly,
“there’s Dolly Merrifield! An’ she saw me a-ridin’! She waved to me!
Did you see her?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” smiled Polly, having glimpsed at the window of a small gray
house a tiny waving hand and a little white face in a halo of
fluttering yellow curls.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad she saw me a-ridin’,” the eager voice went on. “I’ve
wanted to an’ wanted to, till it seemed ’s if I couldn’t stan’ it. An’
now I’m in an’ goin’!” She sighed delightedly.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever been in an automobile before?” was Polly’s somewhat
surprised question.</p>

<p>The small head shook vigorously. “How’d yer s’pose I’d git in?” she
scorned. “Ther’ ain’t none of ’em stop, ’cept the grocery boy an’
the water-pipe man an’ such, an’ they say, ‘You let me ketch yer in
that car, an’ I’ll hand yer over t’ the p’lice&mdash;now d’ yer hear!’ An’
you bet I ain’t goin’ t’ take no such chances ’s that! Johnny Hurley
did, one day, whopped right in over the door, an’ the man give him a
lickin’, ’cause he was his cousin&mdash;my, didn’t he! Johnny couldn’t set
down straight all day.” Presently there came another outburst. “Oh,
wouldn’t Dolly Merrifield like this!&mdash;Do you know Dolly?” Polly shook
her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“Oh, you oughter! Say”&mdash;the brightness faded from the little
face&mdash;“wouldn’t you’ve took her to ride ’stead o’ me if you’d known
her? I guess I’d oughter let Dolly go&mdash;I didn’t think. Honest, I
didn’t! But I guess I’d oughter.” She sighed heavily at this prodding
of conscience.</p>

<p>“Oh, you needn’t worry about that!” comforted Polly. “We can take Dolly
another time, you know. Tell me about her. Who is she?”</p>

<p>“Why, she’s Dolly Merrifield! An’&mdash;oh, she’s the sweetest little thing
you ever saw! She’s got the <em>littlest</em> legs&mdash;just like our baby’s! An’
she don’t <em>never</em> walk! She don’t never <em>stand up</em>! An’ she don’t cry
nor nothin’, ’cept when the lady didn’t come to take her to ride&mdash;then
she did, good an’ hard. Oh, that lady’s just as mean! I wish <em>she</em> had
to sit in a chair all day long, ’ithout anything to do, an’ be all
alone, an’ never go to ride in all her life&mdash;so there!”</p>

<p>The animated face had grown red and scowly during the utterance of this
bitter wish. Now it unexpectedly broke into a delighted grin.</p>

<p>“Did yer honest mean for sure you’d take Dolly to ride?”</p>

<p>“Yes, ‘honest, for sure,’” laughed Polly.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope the lady’ll see her,” the child resumed. “<em>She</em> goes to
ride every day&mdash;two or three times a day! She used to be real pretty;
but I don’t take no stock in her now&mdash;her a-promisin’ Dolly&mdash;an’ Dolly
a-waitin’ an’ a-waitin’&mdash;an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> her never comin’! Dolly wored her eyes
out watchin’ for her&mdash;Mis’ Edmonson said she had. Oh, I jus’ hope she
will see Dolly when you take her&mdash;then I guess!” The small head was
brought down decidedly.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me your name yet,” Polly smiled.</p>

<p>“Oh, my name is Gladys Guinevere Evangeline Smith! But you needn’t go
through all that rigmarole, you can call me Gay; everybody does. An’
ter think of me a-ridin’!”</p>

<p>As the car stopped in front of Gladys Guinevere’s home it found itself
the center of a crowd of girls and boys, mothers and babies, with an
occasional lounger who quite casually started to walk across the street
in front of the machine and quite as casually stopped on the outside of
the circle.</p>

<p>Polly was many times obliged to reiterate her promise to take “Dolly”
to ride; but at last all the questions had been asked and answered and
all the “thank-you’s” and “good-byes” had been said. Then, amid the
scattering onlookers, with much waving of hands on both sides, the car
rolled away.</p>

<h2><a name="viii" id="viii"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span>COUCHES OF CLOVER</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR a whole week Dr. Dudley’s automobile was active in professional
work; then word was brought Polly that the car would be at her disposal
for three hours that afternoon. Her plans were already made, and as
soon as her morning tasks were completed, leaving her mother in charge
of Paradise Ward, Polly started on her way to Prattsboro and Dolly
Merrifield.</p>

<p>The little girl was at the window. “Come in!” she called when Polly
lifted the old brass knocker.</p>

<p>The broad kitchen was alive with sunshine, but the bareness of the big
room struck the girl disagreeably as she opened the door. At first the
child at the window was not visible. Then a winsome little voice said,
“Aunt Sophie isn’t home.”</p>

<p>Polly peeped around the door, and smiled.</p>

<p>“I want to see Miss Dolly Merrifield,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh! me?” exclaimed the little voice.</p>

<p>“If ‘me’ is Dolly,” dimpled Polly, taking the small, thin hand in hers.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course, I’m Dolly! Are you the lady who took Gay to ride?”
she asked shyly.</p>

<p>“The very one,” Polly nodded. “Now, what do you say to a ride yourself
this afternoon?”</p>

<p>The little pale face was pink with surprise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> a kind of awed joy.
“Oh!” she breathed, “oh!&mdash;this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I can have father’s car this afternoon,” Polly explained. “It has been
busy since the day that I made Gladys Guinevere’s acquaintance.”</p>

<p>The little girl smiled. “What a long, funny name she’s got! Mine is
Dorothy, but ’most everybody calls me Dolly. Sometimes Sardis does;
just once in awhile, you know.”</p>

<p>“And who is Sardis?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know Sardis? His name was in the paper, Sardis Elisha
Merrifield. He was the valedictorian of his class.” The long word fell
easily from the small lips.</p>

<p>“At the Grammar School?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, at Yale College! He graduated two years ago. He is a minister,
you know. This summer he is preaching up in Raineville, or he calls
it ‘learning to preach.’ I guess it’s preaching all right.” The
curl-crowned head wagged confidently. “You see, he has been two years
in the Theological School, and he’s got one more year before he can be
a full-fledged minister. Then I’m going to live with him!” Her face
glowed with radiant delight. “He says I am going to live with him if he
has to take me to Kamchatka.”</p>

<p>Polly joined in her laugh.</p>

<p>“Is he the only brother you have?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, he and me and Aunt Sophie are all there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> is. There used to be
father and mother and grandpa and James and Israel and little Dorcas;
but they’ve all gone to heaven. I’ve lived with Aunt Sophie almost
ever since I can remember. Queer, you don’t know Sardis! Seem ’s if
everybody ought to know him, he’s so nice.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall know him some day,” smiled Polly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” echoed Dolly wistfully. “He isn’t here much. I know you’d
like him&mdash;you just couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>Polly had to make her visit a very short one, for she would be needed
by her little charges. She went back to the House of Joy, her heart
full of sympathy for the wee girl who had never walked and who had been
waiting a long year for the ride that had not come. “She shall go as
often as I can take her,” she promised herself as she rode home in the
trolley-car.</p>

<p>Clementina, Muriel, Jeffy, and Little Duke were selected by Polly for
the afternoon’s pleasure, and Dr. Dudley sanctioned her choice.</p>

<p>Aunt Sophie was at home when the automobile stopped in front of the
low-roofed house in Prattsboro. The little maid was at the window, hat
and coat on, and at once all smiles when she saw Polly.</p>

<p>While the chauffeur was carrying his light burden out to the car Polly
found time for a moment’s talk with Dolly’s aunt, and the quiet,
wise-eyed little woman pleased her mightily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The small guest of honor let her tongue play freely, and sympathetic
Polly was sorrowed by her glimpse of the shadow of such an affliction.
A barren, sad little life it must be, yet the tiny maid was seemingly
not yet conscious of any poverty or pathos in her surroundings.</p>

<p>“My brother’s coming home for a day or two sometime this summer,” she
informed Polly. “He said in his last letter that he was going to give
me a ride when he came. But you have got ahead of him,” she chuckled.
“He wanted to take me to hear his valedictory when he was here two
years ago in June; but it rained that day, and I couldn’t go.” For
an instant a shade dulled the little face, then it made way for a
smile. “What do you think!” she broke out, “He delivered his address
to me&mdash;with all the motions, too! Wasn’t that lovely of him? Aunt
Sophie said she guessed not many boys would have done it just to please
a little sister. Oh, he’s the nicest brother in the world! And he
wouldn’t have a new suit after all! We wanted him to; but he said his
old suit was good enough. Of course, he’d look better than the rest,
anyway&mdash;he’s just lovely!”</p>

<p>Behind Polly a ceaseless stream of lively chatter told her that
Clementina was enjoying herself. Jeffy, too, was puncturing the air
with wild exclamations. Presently was heard the voice of Little Duke.</p>

<p>“She will, too, you little stick-in-the-mud! My good boy!&mdash;Mi’ Duddy!
Mi’ Duddy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The girl looked round.</p>

<p>Little Duke almost tumbled towards her in his eagerness.</p>

<p>“Mi’ Duddy, My want to lie down out there.” He pointed to the field of
mossy rocks and lush clover.</p>

<p>“Oh, dearie, I’m afraid it’s damp!”</p>

<p>“No, Mi’ Duddy! Dear Mi’ Duddy, My is good boy! My won’t be damp.”</p>

<p>Polly laughed, but asked Evan to stop while she went on a trip of
investigation. “All right,” was her verdict, on returning to the car.
And instantly there was a clamor of voices from the back seat.</p>

<p>“Oh, may I go, too!”&mdash;“I want to lie on the grass, Miss
Dudley!”&mdash;“Please, can I go?”&mdash;“Do let us, Miss Dudley.”</p>

<p>“We’ll all go,” Polly agreed. And in Evan’s arms the children were
carried, from Little Duke to Dolly Merrifield, to bask among the sunny
clover-blossoms.</p>

<p>Little Duke sucked the sweet blooms, gazing contentedly up at the white
sails on the deep blue sky. Presently he spoke.</p>

<p>“My will stay here all night. My won’t be ’fraid. My will hold you’
hand, Mi’ Duddy.”</p>

<p>“But I shan’t be here,” smiled Polly. “I must go home.”</p>

<p>“My will stay alone. Stars will be here. My will hold Clover’s hand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Still, even clover-blossoms lose their attractiveness after awhile,
especially when there is a cushioned automobile in waiting; and after
a quarter-hour of the sunny couch Little Duke was ready to relinquish
present sweets for the swift-rolling car.</p>

<p>“Did you like it?” Polly smiled down into the white little face beside
her. She fancied it held a faint reflection of the clover’s own color.</p>

<p>“Oh, it seemed as if it must be heaven!” sighed Dolly Merrifield softly.</p>

<p>It was a very tired little girl that Evan laid carefully on the couch
in Aunt Sophie’s living-room. But her eyes were shining with joy. She
put out a small hand and caught one of Polly’s.</p>

<p>“May I kiss you?” she whispered. “I want to because you have given me
such a lovely, lovely time. I’m going to tell Sardis all about it and
how good you’ve been to me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, darling,” Polly whispered back. “I think outdoors is what
you need, and just as soon as I can get the car again you shall have
another ride.”</p>

<p>Dolly looked her thanks, but said not a word beyond a softly breathed
“O-h!”</p>

<h2><a name="ix" id="ix"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span>NO. 45678</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T the dinner table Polly told her story of the afternoon’s pleasure.</p>

<p>“I am glad you can take them out,” said Dr. Dudley. “The air will do
them more good than anything else.”</p>

<p>“I know it will,” agreed Polly confidently. “They ought to have it
every day.”</p>

<p>“You may have the car as often as possible,” promised the Doctor. Then
he addressed his wife on another subject.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Polly was busy with captivating new thoughts, and shortly she
sent a question straight into their talk.</p>

<p>“How much money have I in&mdash;Oh, I do beg your pardon!” she cried,
meeting her father’s glance. Then she laughed. “I had been thinking and
didn’t even know you were talking.”</p>

<p>“What is it that is so engrossing?” smiled her mother.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” she returned gayly. “Father, how much money have I in
the bank?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I can give you some&mdash;how much?” He thrust his hand into
his pocket.</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried Polly; “I don’t want any now&mdash;none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> of yours at all.
May I take some of my money and buy whatever I choose?”</p>

<p>“It depends on what you wish it for and how much it costs.”</p>

<p>“It can cost almost any amount, but I’ll try to be contented with a
cheap one. Father, I want to buy an automobile and learn to run it
myself.” Her eyes were bent anxiously on his face.</p>

<p>“No, Robert,” interposed Mrs. Dudley, “don’t let her! I shouldn’t be
easy a minute.”</p>

<p>The Doctor smiled. “She is equal to it, Lucy&mdash;you needn’t worry; though
it seems rather unnecessary when there’s a good car in the family
already.”</p>

<p>“But how seldom I can have it,” argued Polly. “And those children need
the rides every day. If you could have seen them this afternoon!” She
stopped&mdash;waiting.</p>

<p>The Doctor sat back in his chair and studied the pattern of the
tablecloth. The eyes of both women were on his face.</p>

<p>“I’ll think about it,” he finally said. “I don’t like the idea of your
cutting into that little sum. You know what I have saved it for, Polly.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face flushed. “I know, father.” She faced him with steady
eyes. “There’s no use keeping it for that. I shall never marry.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, child! you will marry a good deal sooner than I shall wish,
but&mdash;I’ll think it over.”</p>

<p>The door had scarcely shut upon the Doctor before Polly clapped her
hands softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
“Father’s ‘I’ll think it over’ is every bit as good as a straight-out
yes.”</p>

<p>“Polly, I don’t want you to have a car if you must drive it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Why, mother dear, it isn’t anything to run one now.”</p>

<p>“Not simply to run it. In case of emergencies, however, one must
possess nerves that are under perfect control.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Polly answered gravely; “but what is the matter with mine?
Besides, I shouldn’t drive fast or run any risks.”</p>

<p>“I should worry about you every minute. Foolish, you and your father
would say; but I should all the same.”</p>

<p>“Don’t!&mdash;for I dreadfully want one. If you could have seen how Little
Duke enjoyed it to-day!” And she repeated his remarks.</p>

<p>Within a week Polly had her license and she and Evan were spinning over
the country roads in the new car, Polly chuckling over her number,
which she declared was the very best in the whole list. She was an apt
pupil, and absolutely without fear. Mrs. Dudley soon decided to take
some of the children and occupy the back seat, rather than wait at home
wondering if anything had happened, and her first ride with Polly at
the wheel seemed to rid her of all apprehension. She argued no more
against the new machine.</p>

<p>The car was in use whenever its owner could take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> out any of her small
patients or leave them. None needed skilled care throughout the day,
and several of her friends were ready to act as substitute for an hour
or two at almost any time. Patricia or Lilith or Hilda would frequently
be found in charge of Paradise Ward, while Polly and her mother were
downtown on a shopping excursion or on some visit across the city.</p>

<p>She had run down alone one afternoon to make some small purchases,
when, on coming out of a shop, she found herself facing John Eustis.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to know you are still in the flesh,” he began. “I never get
sight of you nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Is it as much as a week since I saw you at Vesta Jordan’s?” smiled
Polly.</p>

<p>He laughed his answer. And then, “Going home? May I walk up with you?”</p>

<p>“You may ride up with me. I drove down, that being the quickest way.”</p>

<p>They were silent until they were beyond the business streets.</p>

<p>“You have a dandy car, and you are an expert in running it,” praised
John Eustis. “That bit of maneuvering was well done.”</p>

<p>Polly looked pleased.</p>

<p>“I am not wholly sure of myself yet,” she admitted; “but I haven’t made
any big break since I gave up Evan. Even mother isn’t afraid to ride
with me.”</p>

<p>“She has no need to be afraid,” he returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“I am glad you think so,” was all Polly said.</p>

<p>“I should have come up to your house to-night,” went on John Eustis,
“if I had not met you. Can you get off from your job for a week-end?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not. I have enlisted and I must stick to my post.”</p>

<p>“You ought not to have enlisted.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I ought! I wouldn’t give it up for anything.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll be more persuadable when you hear where I want you to go.”</p>

<p>Polly looked at him questioningly.</p>

<p>“Do you remember Sally Robinson?”</p>

<p>“How could I forget Sally! She was one of the dearest girls in our
class.”</p>

<p>“She was&mdash;and she is. And she is home from Texas&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here?” cried Polly.</p>

<p>“No, at Overlook&mdash;up on the mountain.”</p>

<p>“Where is that?”</p>

<p>“In Vermont, just beyond the line. Kate had a letter from her this
morning. She has invited mother and you and Kate and me&mdash;and she says
as many more of the girls as we can pile into our car&mdash;to come up on
Saturday to stay until Monday, longer if we can.”</p>

<p>Polly’s face had grown bright and grave by turns. “You going?” she
asked wistfully.</p>

<p>“We are, most decidedly. Wouldn’t miss it for a farm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
“I wish I could,” sighed Polly.</p>

<p>“You can! You must!”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure.” A little scowl troubled her forehead.</p>

<p>“Remember, it is Sally that asks you,” he coaxed.</p>

<p>“I don’t forget,” she returned. “I will go if I can manage it; but when
I am away somebody must stay with my little patients, and it is not
in my plan to call on mother all the time. I promised to take care of
Paradise Ward, and I won’t be a slacker.”</p>

<p>The young man did not reply. Polly was gazing straight ahead into the
distance, as if her thoughts were a long way afield. As he looked,
his face took on alternately grave lines and gladsome. He, too, was
following paths quite afar from the state road.</p>

<p>Soon they were making a slow passage over a thoroughfare that was
being repaired. Polly had thrown aside her other problem and was
concentrating all her knowledge and skill upon her not easy task. The
street was full of pedestrians and automobiles, and one needed a clear
head, quick thought, and ready hands. John Eustis was an expert driver,
yet he discovered no flaw in Polly’s management.</p>

<p>When the road was clear, “Another score in your favor,” he smiled.
“Evan must be a good instructor.”</p>

<p>“He is,” she returned. “John, I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> thinking&mdash;I believe I can
see my way to go. How early shall you start?”</p>

<p>“Eight or nine in the morning, if possible. It is better to get over a
good piece in the cool of the day. Something more than a hundred miles,
and we don’t want to take it too fast.”</p>

<p>“It will be a lovely drive, along by the Connecticut.”</p>

<p>He nodded. Things were going happily. “What other girl shall we invite?
The car will hold one more.”</p>

<p>“Have you thought of anybody?”</p>

<p>“Kate spoke of Grace Comstock and Lilith Brooks and Claire House. She
didn’t seem to have any preference.”</p>

<p>“And you have none yourself?” queried Polly.</p>

<p>A dull red crept into his cheeks; but instantly it was not there.</p>

<p>“Anybody that pleases you,” he answered.</p>

<p>Polly hesitated&mdash;what made John blush? Had he a choice which he did not
wish to make known? Then she said, “Suppose you invite Lilith. She has
always liked Sally, and she is a good traveling companion.”</p>

<p>“I will ask her to-night and tell her you are going.”</p>

<p>“No, no! Don’t tell her that!” cried Polly. “I can’t say positively
until I have seen father and one of the nurses. I’ll let you know.”</p>

<p>And with that he had to be content.</p>

<p>Polly stood before her mother in her trim gray suit, her eyes shining
with an unusual brightness, her whole being indicative of imprisoned
emotion.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t, mother! I couldn’t! I had to come home to talk it over
with you and father!” Polly was hurriedly pulling off her gloves, her
joyous heedlessness reaching even to her finger-tips.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dudley had grown suddenly limp.</p>

<p>“Has David&mdash;” she began.</p>

<p>“No, no; it isn’t anything about David.” Polly’s voice had never
sounded like that when she spoke of David.</p>

<p>“I don’t much care what it is, then.” Mrs. Dudley sat up straight and
drew a little relieved breath. “It seems as if I couldn’t stand his
coming back&mdash;now. But I don’t see why you didn’t stay as you expected
to. Didn’t Kate stay?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, mother; but I just couldn’t!&mdash;I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have a good time? Anything gone wrong?”</p>

<p>“Yes to the first, and no to the second. Don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> be in a hurry! To begin
with, Overlook Mountain is the very loveliest place on earth.”</p>

<p>“And yet you left it,” laughed her mother.</p>

<p>Polly laughed, too. “Had to!” she said happily. “Oh, the road up the
mountain!&mdash;I wish you could see it. Through the most beautiful woods!
Ferns!&mdash;I thought I knew ferns, but I didn’t. Millions of them, almost
as tall as you are, and so luxurious&mdash;why, the sides of the road look
as if they had just been decorated for a wedding!&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What about a wedding?” came from Dr. Dudley in the doorway. “Evan said
you had just come, and I couldn’t understand it. You were so eager to
stay the week out.”</p>

<p>“I know it. Mother’s had everything bad happening; but it’s all
right&mdash;or will be if you agree with me&mdash;oh, father, you would in one
minute if you could see Overlook! Why, when I got there and looked
around I felt as if I were right on top of the world&mdash;it is beautiful,
it is grand! Father, what do you suppose I want to do?”</p>

<p>“No telling what rattle-brained scheme is in that head of yours. Out
with it! I never could bear suspense.”</p>

<p>Polly laughed, a laugh that made her father look at her with joyful
eyes. This was his own old Polly, before she had begun to be worried
with troubles of David Collins’s making.</p>

<p>“Well,” began the girl, holding her excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> in check, “I want to
move Paradise Ward up on Overlook for the summer and autumn.”</p>

<p>Nobody spoke. They looked at one another, anxiety on Polly’s side,
astonishment and half comprehension on the other.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it, little daughter.” Dr. Dudley drew up a chair.</p>

<p>So Polly told; of her delight in the spot; of the marvelous beauty of
the view; of the wonderful, intoxicating air; of the plan that had
suddenly popped into her head when she waked on Sunday morning; of the
news that had greeted her at breakfast, just fitting into her scheme,
about the brother and sister, owners of a bungalow and a study on the
top of Overlook, who had just been left a fortune in Switzerland and
wished to sell their property on the mountain; how it seemed the one
place for Paradise Ward to get strong in; and of how she could not wait
an hour beyond to-day to tell her father of her plan and to beg him to
accede to her wish.</p>

<p>She was quiet at last, watching with eager eyes her father’s face.</p>

<p>“Have you thought of the money it would cost to carry out this plan?”
asked the Doctor quietly.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she acknowledged, “it must depend on Mrs. Gresham; but I
know she will be interested in less than a minute.”</p>

<p>“She surely will be. That, however, is not the question. She has spent
a fortune on Paradise Ward already.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“She loves to spend it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he conceded; “yet is it wise for us to incite her to further
spending?”</p>

<p>“It truly is,” returned Polly with assurance. “Think of those dear
children! Oh, if you could see them outdoors as I do! The rides have
done them no end of good&mdash;you know how Little Duke has improved.”</p>

<p>Dr. Dudley brightened. “That boy’s gain is astonishing.”</p>

<p>“And it isn’t medicine that has done it,” observed Polly; “it is fresh
air.”</p>

<p>The Doctor nodded musingly.</p>

<p>Polly’s thoughts skipped from Little Duke to Esther Tenniel, the gentle
little English maid who&mdash;however shy she might be with others&mdash;never
hesitated to put her arms round the Doctor’s neck, just as if she were
his own little girl. “I believe,” she said, “that a few months of
Overlook would make a new child of Esther.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see it tried,” Dr. Dudley admitted.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll try it!” exclaimed Polly ecstatically.</p>

<p>“I shall have to leave it to your judgment,” said the Doctor. “I don’t
like to beg for too much.”</p>

<p>“Beg!” laughed Polly&mdash;“oh, father!”</p>

<p>“You haven’t even asked for my approval,” smiled Mrs. Dudley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
“I don’t need to. I know well enough just what you’d say,” retorted
Polly.</p>

<p>“I should like to know.”</p>

<p>“Why, you’d say, ‘Go ahead!’” Polly laughed. “And I think I’d better
see Mrs. Gresham this evening. Don’t you want to go down with me,
mother? Do, and help the good cause along.&mdash;Oh, I forgot! That boy is
coming up to-night.”</p>

<p>“What boy?” queried her mother.</p>

<p>“John Eustis. Well,” sighing, “we’ll have to put it off till morning.”</p>

<p>That Mrs. Gresham was “interested” in Polly’s plan nobody could doubt.
The lady’s enthusiasm more than justified Polly’s prediction.</p>

<p>“I must see the place at once!” she cried. “We’ll go up to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“To-morrow!” gasped Polly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” returned Mrs. Gresham. “No time to lose. Summer is well on
her way. You can go to-morrow, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;guess so,” the girl answered dazedly. She glanced towards her
mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dudley smiled assent.</p>

<p>“And you’ll go with us?” invited the elder woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dudley shook her head. “I’m afraid&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! She can, can’t she, Polly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, mother. I’m longing to have you see it.”</p>

<p>She still shook her head, but, as Polly said, the shakes were less
emphatic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
“Let’s start by six o’clock,” went on Mrs. Gresham. “To-day would have
been lovely, but probably to-morrow will be just as nice. You say we
can have it now, and with all the furniture?”</p>

<p>“All there is,” Polly answered. “Of course, there’ll have to be a good
deal besides. The living-room is so large and beautiful it will make a
lovely ward. At each end is a wide casement window, one opening on the
road, the other on the wood&mdash;where the deer come down. As I said, about
five acres of timber-land go with the place. The house is the best
located of all on the mountain, with woods on the north which break the
heavy winds. There’s a big fireplace in the living-room, and all sorts
of pretty nooks and corners, with shelves and bookracks&mdash;oh, you’ll go
crazy over it, just as I did! The big room is two stories high, and the
stairs lead right up from that to a little balcony which runs clear
across the side and opens into the bedrooms. The other building is not
far away, an inscription in such pretty letters, <span class="smcap">The Study</span>, is
right over the door. You see, the young man is a lawyer, and that was
his den. It will do beautifully for a dormitory for the older boys and
the doctor that father sends with us&mdash;of course, we’ll have to have a
doctor.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” echoed Mrs. Gresham absently. “The brother and sister
gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, nobody left but the housekeeper, Benedicta Clapperton&mdash;isn’t that
a name? But she’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> a dear. She told me she hoped I’d buy the place, for
she ‘appertained’ to it, and she ‘cackerlated’ I was the ‘facsimile’
of her ‘dear Miss Flora.’ She adores children, and Sally says she is a
wonder in the cooking line; so she will probably stuff the ward with
soldiers and sailors and a whole barnyard besides. But I have fallen in
love with her, and I believe she will be our strongest asset&mdash;just you
wait and see!”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Gresham and Mrs. Dudley were face to face with the “strongest
asset” they recalled Polly’s statement in some surprise.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gresham had intuitively pictured the caretaker as middle-aged,
plump, and comfortable, with a benevolent smile and a gracious manner.
The woman who stood before them was tall, straight, and lean, with a
small head and high cheek-bones. Her abundant brown hair was drawn
smoothly back from her low forehead and wound into a tight coil on top
of her head. Her frankly curious eyes of light gray appeared to size up
her visitors in one unafraid glance, and she extended a big, work-hard
hand with a drawling “How d’ ye do?”</p>

<p>So this was Benedicta!</p>

<p>Polly chanced to make a trivial remark, and Mrs. Gresham turned with
relief.</p>

<p>Although the visitors had stopped on the way for luncheon, the
housekeeper insisted that they should “stay to dinner,” and already
a small table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> in the living-room was most attractively set with
appointments for three.</p>

<p>“Yes, Benedicta can cook,” Mrs. Gresham mentally conceded, as she ate
with relish the broiled chicken, creamed pease, hot rye muffins with
home-made butter, red raspberry pie, and hot coffee topped with whipped
cream.</p>

<p>Nor did she withhold her praise; upon which Benedicta expanded like a
flower which needs only the sunshine to bloom into beauty. Not that in
the one happy moment the cook grew handsome, or that she expressed her
thanks in suitable words. Only her small eyes grew bright and soft, her
thin cheeks reddened with pleasure, as she said, almost scornfully,
“Amazin’ly astounding ’f I didn’t know how to cook! Been at it since I
was an infant.”</p>

<p>Opinions are versatile notions at best. After that informal meal on
Overlook Mountain the critical wife of Colonel Gresham looked at
Benedicta in a humorous and therefore fairer light, and the light in
which a person is viewed makes all the difference in one’s opinion of
him.</p>

<p>The next day when the party started for home the Von Winkelried
property had passed into the hands of Mrs. Gresham, and the Children’s
House of Joy was in legal possession of a mountain summer home.</p>

<h2><a name="xi" id="xi"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span>DR. ABBE</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">A</span>LTHOUGH Mrs. Gresham and Polly were most closely concerned in the
plans that crowded the next week, Dr. Dudley’s home and the entire
hospital were a little off their balance. Mrs. Gresham was chiefly
occupied in arranging for minor alterations in the new Overlook Home
and purchasing furniture and other appointments that would be needed;
while Polly and her mother inspected the small patients’ old clothing
and ordered new, for nights would be cool up on the mountain and
suitable garments must be ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>All the nurses were wondering whose services would be required for the
new sanitarium, and each hoped the good fortune would be hers. The rest
of the summer among the Vermont hills, with Polly for companion and
only a dozen or so interesting children to care for, was a snap to be
eagerly caught up. Not many of the doctors appeared to be giving much
thought to the matter; only two or three let it be understood that they
had no desire to be dispatched to the “Top of the World,” with a few
kids and two or three girls for sole company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
It was at dinner that Dr. Dudley and Polly first touched upon the
subject of helpers for the Overlook home.</p>

<p>“You had better take two nurses with you,” observed the Doctor.</p>

<p>“How could I need them?” returned Polly. “Unless in case of an
epidemic,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” replied the physician. “I want you to have a good rest.”</p>

<p>“Yes, two are none too many,” added Mrs. Dudley.</p>

<p>The girl scowled musingly. “I am afraid they will be in the way,” she
demurred. “It depends on which can go.”</p>

<p>“How should you like Miss Curtis and the assistant dietitian?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be well to have a dietitian along,” she answered.
“Only Benedicta may object.”</p>

<p>“We won’t ask her permission. It shall be Mrs. Daybill and Miss Curtis,
then.”</p>

<p>“No, no! I don’t need Miss Curtis. I’ll tell you what I have thought
of,” she went on. “You know, Lilith hasn’t been feeling quite up to the
mark lately, and she is so handy with children, I have been wondering
if it wouldn’t be a good plan to ask her to go with us. I am sure she
would like nothing better.”</p>

<p>“First-rate. Unless the children are really ill Lilith will do as well
as any one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
“Of course, we must have a physician. Can you spare Dr. Abbe?”</p>

<p>Her father gave a little laugh. “He must be obviously fit, since we
both had him in mind.”</p>

<p>“And I, too,” smiled Mrs. Dudley.</p>

<p>Polly clapped her hands softly. “He is so shy,” she explained, “I think
he will do better than any one else. He won’t be bothering round&mdash;like
Dr. Marston, for example.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Abbe is a fine young fellow,” commented the physician.</p>

<p>“And a good doctor, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He is all right,” nodded her father.</p>

<p>“But suppose he shouldn’t want to go? I heard that Dr. Leggett is
hoping <em>he</em> won’t be called.”</p>

<p>“Leggett has too many interests here in town.”</p>

<p>“One big interest,” Polly smiled. “Dr. Abbe is too diffident to look at
a girl; but the children like him immensely. He is bashful even with
them&mdash;I have noticed it. Strange he should be, so able a man.”</p>

<p>The Doctor looked at Polly meditatively. Only that afternoon he had
seen this same shy young surgeon stop to gaze from a window that
commanded the garden where Polly was gathering sweet pease. He wondered
now if it would be wise to send Dr. Abbe to Overlook.</p>

<p>Polly glanced up from her plate to meet her father’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking&mdash;how should you like Dr. Prowitt, instead of Abbe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, the children can’t bear him! Little Duke would have a
fit, if he were along. Didn’t I tell you what he said? The Doctor had
just been in, and Little Duke looked up at me and asked, with a queer
expression, ‘You like him, Mi’ Duddy?’</p>

<p>“‘He’s all right,’ I answered. He eyed me closely, and then
said,&mdash;‘Docker Prow’t is a b-i-g w-i-n-d that comes down the street
’thout any sunshine.’ And you ought to have heard him say it&mdash;away down
in his throat. No, I couldn’t stand ‘Docker Prow’t’ up at Overlook!”</p>

<p>They laughed; then the physician grew grave again.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;I didn’t know,” was all that he said; but he left the table
still wondering if he ought to send Dr. Abbe.</p>

<p>Of course, there was just a chance that Polly at the sweet-pea bed
might not have been the brilliant objective point of the Doctor’s eyes.
If only this had been the first time! Well, perhaps he and Polly could
compromise on one of the others.</p>

<p>The girl, however, had no doubts concerning the wisdom of selecting the
shy young surgeon for the House physician of Overlook, and within an
hour she had settled the matter beyond recall.</p>

<p>Quite by chance Polly met Dr. Abbe while on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> her way to June Holiday
Home. She was about to pass him with a pleasant word when she stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dr. Abbe!” she cried, “have you seen father?”</p>

<p>The Doctor looked troubled.</p>

<p>“Not since dinner. Is he missing?”</p>

<p>“No,” laughed Polly. “I meant about Overlook. We were wondering at
dinner how you would like the appointment.”</p>

<p>The young man’s face flamed. “Indeed, few things would give me as much
pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Then it is all right,” Polly exclaimed. “I thought you’d fill the
position better than anybody else&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Dudley, you are too flattering.”</p>

<p>“No, it is true. The children just adore you.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Polly went on, “I told father I thought you’d be the very best
one to go with us, and he agreed with me. I didn’t know but he had seen
you already.”</p>

<p>“I am very much obliged to you for your good opinion,” he replied, his
face still aflush. “How soon are you going?” he added.</p>

<p>“As soon as we can get ready. It may be lonely for you,” she suggested.
“It is miles away from anybody, except a few farmers along the side of
the mountain, and you feel farther off than you really are, because
only one farmhouse is in sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
“I could never be lonely, Miss Dudley, never,” he assured her. “I am
certain I shall love it all.” His blush deepened as he let slip the
word.</p>

<p>“That’s jolly,” Polly smiled. “It was the only thing I was afraid of.
I am so glad you aren’t that kind. I think the sunsets up there&mdash;yes,
and the sunrises&mdash;must be magnificent. And the air! If you have never
been up on a Vermont mountain you can have scarcely any idea of the
wonderful air. I am sure it will do the children no end of good.”</p>

<p>Of course, Dr. Abbe thought just as Polly did, and they soon parted,
the girl to forget all about the young physician, and Dr. Abbe to
wonder if his good fortune were really true or if he were dreaming.</p>

<h2><a name="xii" id="xii"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span>PATRICIA AND A FEW OTHERS</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">D</span>URING these days that were filled to the very brim with plans and
the carrying-out of them Polly had little time for thoughts of David
or herself. Not a word had come from her quondam lover, until she had
almost ceased to expect to hear from him. To her astonishment, when she
had time for reflection, she found that David did not seem to occupy
the same place in her heart as before this overpowering interest in the
hospital’s new possession. She did not quite understand it. She felt
that she still loved David as well as ever, yet she was as confident as
she had been on that night down at Samoosic Point, that she could not
accept more promises which were almost sure to be broken.</p>

<p>Occasionally came a day when she would long for David with all the
ardor of her nature. Even Overlook would seem commonplace in comparison
with this irresistible passion to be to him what she once had been.
Patricia, never very tactful, spoke one morning of David.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he ever write to you?” she asked.</p>

<p>Polly’s simple negative did not satisfy her.</p>

<p>“Great lover he is!” she burst out. “It shows how much he really
cares&mdash;to break off in this fashion!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
“But, Patty, you know we were never engaged,” returned Polly, flushing
and paling with the memories which were thus suddenly brought before
her.</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t his fault,” Patricia laughed. “Don’t you honestly think,
Polly, that if you had consented to an engagement he wouldn’t have been
so jealous? You see, then he’d have been sure of you.”</p>

<p>Polly shook her head. “It would have been just the same,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” the other concluded. “But I do know this&mdash;you
have been too meek from the first. If you’d flirted round with the
other boys, he’d have got used to it. Even now you stick to him, I know
you do; you haven’t been with anybody else all summer long. Catch me
being so loyal to a man of David Collins’s caliber! Why don’t you wake
up and have a good time? You know you could have anybody in our set.
They’d run for you if you’d as much as wave your little finger, every
man of them.”</p>

<p>“Patricia Illingworth! what nonsense you are talking! I am not in need
of any man, and you know I abominate flirting. I shall never marry. I
am going to be a nurse&mdash;I have made up my mind.”</p>

<p>“A nurse! a nurse! Polly Dudley a nurse!” Patricia swayed in a paroxysm
of glee. “That’s too funny!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything to laugh at,” grumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> Polly. “Don’t be so
silly!” as Patricia broke into fresh giggles.</p>

<p>“What will you wager that you’ll be engaged before I am?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Patty, stop your nonsense! I am in no mood for fun of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Then you ought to be. This nursing business right on top of the David
affair is making a regular nun of you. I think I’ll speak to your
father about it.”</p>

<p>“I think you won’t! I want you to come up to Overlook and stay a week
next month. Will you?”</p>

<p>“A week in that out-of-the-world place? I should die of homesickness.
Who’s going to be there, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Just the children and the housekeeper, and one doctor and the
dietitian, besides me.”</p>

<p>“And ‘me’ is worth the whole posse put together. Which doctor?”</p>

<p>“Dr. Abbe.”</p>

<p>“Abbe? Abbe?&mdash;oh! that good-looking little fellow? Does he know how to
flirt?”</p>

<p>“I hope not! He knows too much to be a fool. If he didn’t I wouldn’t
have him there.”</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll come and teach him how&mdash;yes, I’ll come.”</p>

<p>“You won’t come to visit me unless you promise not to lead him on&mdash;to
nothing. Besides, you might get caught in your own toils.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
“I can take care of myself, thank you.”</p>

<p>“I am not so sure of that,” Polly demurred. “You didn’t use to be this
way, Patty. What’s the matter?” She had dropped into a confidential
tone.</p>

<p>Patricia’s face grew pink. She laughed uncertainly. “Oh, I’m all
right!” she returned, stooping ostensibly to tie her shoe, which the
other was positive did not need tying.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” Polly went on softly; “I like you best as you always
have been. You are too much a woman to be a flirt.”</p>

<p>“It’s fun!” laughed Patricia. “You may as well break men’s hearts as to
have them break yours.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the girls met, Polly’s soft with sympathy, the other’s
sharp with recklessness.</p>

<p>The next minute Patricia was rattling on again. “I don’t believe I’ll
come up, after all,” she observed lightly. “I’m afraid Abbe isn’t a
good sport. Why don’t you take Marston? He knows how to keep up his
end.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want him,” replied Polly.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he feel flattered to know that!” laughed Patricia.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t like the position. He would want to go down to Overlook
every evening. You know Lilith is going up to help me?”</p>

<p>“No! Is she really? I’m afraid you will both die of lonesomeness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
“We shall love it,” Polly assured her with emphasis.</p>

<p>“I’m willing. On the whole I think I’ll come. How soon you going?”</p>

<p>“Next week if the cabin is ready.”</p>

<p>“How alluring that sounds! Bye-bye! Be good to yourself, and don’t fall
in love with that little Abbe!&mdash;No, dear, don’t come down, I can let
myself out.”</p>

<p>Polly turned back to her room with a faint smile. “Fall in love with
Dr. Abbe!” she scorned. She had been writing to her Cousin Floyd. He
was about to be married, and when Patricia came she was explaining
to him why she could not be present at the wedding. She took up the
half-written note upon her desk.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t want to go, anyway,” she said to herself. “I am not
interested in weddings&mdash;I wonder if I ever shall be.”</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes brimmed. “Oh, David,” she sobbed softly, “why
couldn’t you trust me!”</p>

<p>Tears eased the tension, and presently her thoughts touched Patricia.
So she, too, had become acquainted with sorrow. Her old friend was
surely not the sweet-hearted Patty she had known so long. Could the
trouble have to do with John Eustis? Until quite recently the two
had seemed to drift together wherever they might be, and Polly had
sometimes wondered if they cared seriously for each other. Now she
recalled that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> Patty seldom spoke of him in a personal way, and her
name had not been included in John’s list of possible members of the
week-end party at Overlook. Patricia was not a girl to give confidences
freely. Hitherto she had never seemed other than happy; and her griefs
if any existed had not been shared even with Polly.</p>

<p>That afternoon in the bookshop she met John Eustis. As he waited at a
counter, she fancied that he was graver than usual; then, as he turned,
a smile illuminated his plain face, and he came forward quickly.</p>

<p>“It’s an age since I’ve seen you!” he exclaimed. “I was afraid you had
gone.”</p>

<p>“Not till next week. Mrs. Gresham decided that the kitchen must be
enlarged and have a piazza of its own; so we’re waiting until the
addition is floored and shut in. I am wondering what Benedicta will
say.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Write me. It will be worth hearing.”</p>

<p>“Come up to Overlook and hear it,” Polly returned. “Why can’t you and
Kate?&mdash;Do!” She was about to add, “Patricia has promised me a week,”
but a sudden impulse made her wait.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can,” he answered, with thanks, his face lighting. “Kate
would be overjoyed. I mustn’t tell her just yet,” he laughed, “or she
wouldn’t give me any peace until we were in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> car, ready to start.
But I will surely try to bring her up before you come home.”</p>

<p>Now was her time!</p>

<p>“I do hope you will,” she said. “I want a visit from all my friends
while we are there. It would be jolly to have a regular house party,
but that is impossible. Patricia has promised me a week&mdash;if only you
and Kate could come then!” She was furtively watching his face, and
noted the almost tragic expression that suddenly swept it. The pallor
was closely followed by a veritable blush, even up to his hair. She had
caught him unawares, and guiltily she dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>Straightway John was under control, saying in even tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>“That would be fine, indeed; but it is barely possible that I shall not
be able to come at that time. Business must be considered first, you
know, and we are unusually busy this summer.”</p>

<p>Polly went back to her car, where the children were waiting, feeling
that one thing was sure&mdash;it was John Eustis who had caused Patricia’s
bitter, reckless mood. But what was the trouble? That would be harder
to discover.</p>

<p>Her patients chattered and laughed with one another; occasionally the
little one who sat between her and Evan would call her attention to
something along the wayside and receive an absent answer; but Polly’s
mind was engaged with matters far from the country road. What was the
trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> between Patricia and John? If she could only get them up
to Overlook at the same time! But&mdash;well, perhaps she had better let
matchmaking alone. She hoped it would right itself&mdash;John was such a
nice boy!</p>

<h2><a name="xiii" id="xiii"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span>WHAT SARDIS SAID</span></h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">P</span>OLLY was preparing the chosen ones of her small flock for a ride. Of
late automobile rides had been few, the driver’s time having been too
full of indoor work. “They will live outdoors in a few days,” she told
herself, when her conscience had pricked her for keeping them in the
heat of Paradise Ward. But this morning no pressing task was at hand,
and she happily made ready for a short ride into the country, planning
to call for Dolly Merrifield on the way.</p>

<p>“Miss Dudley, there’s a woman downstairs who wants to see you,”
announced Andrew, one of the orderlies.</p>

<p>“Didn’t she give her name?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, she didn’t. I’ll step down and find out.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” returned Polly. “Probably it’s about one of the patients,
and it isn’t I she wants at all. If you’ll see to the ward a minute,
Andrew, I’ll be right back.”</p>

<p>As Polly entered the reception room a plump little woman arose and
greeted her.</p>

<p>“Why, good-morning, Mrs. Edmonson,” cried Polly. “I was just going out
to your house, to take Dolly to ride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The woman shook her head sadly. “I’m afraid she won’t be able to go.
Thank you just the same; but she isn’t a bit well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry,” responded Polly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s too bad. I think it may be the heat, we’ve had such awful
weather; but I don’t know. It’s about her I’ve come down this morning.
I didn’t know but your father would go up and see her some day; I felt
he’d be better than anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” returned Polly, “and he’ll be glad to come. What
seems to be the matter&mdash;just weakness?”</p>

<p>“Yes. She sits there looking like a little angel, and growing whiter
and whiter every day. I carry her out to the doorstep after the sun
is gone, but it don’t seem to do her much good. I’m afraid she’s just
fading away. If anything does happen, I don’t know what Sardis will do.
That child is the very apple of his eye.”</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry, so sorry,” Polly sighed. “I’m sure father will come to
see her right away&mdash;I’ll find out.” She stepped to a telephone and took
up the receiver.</p>

<p>“Is father there?... Will you please say that Polly wishes to speak
with him.” Presently she came back.</p>

<p>“Father says he will drive up to see her at five o’clock this
afternoon. Now, don’t worry another bit. I feel sure that he will bring
her out all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> You think she couldn’t bear even a short ride?
Well, perhaps we’d better wait and see.”</p>

<p>Dr. Dudley was a little late to dinner. Polly waited for him anxiously.
She had become attached to little Dolly Merrifield, for helplessness
always appealed to her, and the tiny girl was rarely attractive.</p>

<p>Presently she heard a step in the hall, and the Doctor walked in.</p>

<p>“I stayed too long to visit with my patient,” he said as he sipped his
soup. “Have I kept you waiting? Where is your mother?”</p>

<p>“Why, mother’s at the church to-night. Don’t you remember? She told you
she shouldn’t be home. No, dinner hasn’t waited a great while. I am
glad you were only visiting. I was afraid Dolly might be worse&mdash;how is
she?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t discover any urgent need for alarm. The child is in a bad
way; but we must remedy that. She needs good country air and food. I
fancy Mrs. Edmonson doesn’t set a hotel table. Evidently there is not
too much money. What does the son do, did you say?”</p>

<p>“The son? Oh, Dolly’s brother! He is a minister away up in New
Hampshire, graduated from Yale two years ago.”</p>

<p>“Probably he isn’t making a fortune, then,” he smiled. “I wish the
child was up there with him. But I don’t see why you can’t take her
along with you. It will be better than any tonic I could give her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
“To Overlook? Oh, I wish I could!”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, I didn’t suppose they’d let her go, and then when
I heard how weak she is I thought it wouldn’t be of any use even to
think of it.”</p>

<p>“’Twon’t hurt her a mite&mdash;do her good.”</p>

<p>“You think she can bear that long trip?”</p>

<p>The Doctor nodded. “She might have to lie down on the way, but that
would be easy enough.”</p>

<p>Polly’s face had grown very bright. “I should love to have her with
us,” she responded. “What did they say? Or didn’t you speak of it?”</p>

<p>Dr. Dudley shook his head. “I said nothing of Overlook. Probably they
will be glad to have her go; they ought to be. You’d better see Mrs.
Edmonson at once. The time is getting short.”</p>

<p>Dolly’s aunt did not receive the proposition as gladly as had been
expected.</p>

<p>“You see,” she explained, “I’m afraid Sardis wouldn’t hear to letting
her go so far with strangers. Of course,” she hastened to add, “I’d be
willing enough; it might do her no end of good. But Sardis, he is so
afraid something will happen to her. It’s nice of you to want to take
her, and I’ll write him to-day; though I haven’t much hope he’ll let
her go.”</p>

<p>As for Dolly herself, she sat in her cushioned chair, eager-eyed at
first, but disappointed as she listened to her aunt’s objections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
“Why, Aunt Sophie,” she once ventured to pipe, in her tired little
voice, “I do guess it would make me ’most well, same as Miss Dudley
says. I know I could coax Sardis to say yes, if I only had him here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt you could,” returned her aunt with a little laugh;
“Sardis would tear the house down and make a bonfire of it if you
wanted him to; but he ain’t here, and I don’t know. I expect, though,
he’ll be against it, he’s so careful.”</p>

<p>Polly went over and sat down by the little girl before leaving.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, dear! Maybe Sardis will say yes&mdash;who knows!”</p>

<p>“He would if he was some folks,” returned Mrs. Edmonson; “but he isn’t.
I know just what his answer will be.”</p>

<p>The brightness which had come into Dolly’s face vanished and left it
listless and dull.</p>

<p>Aunt Sophie, also, grew sad.</p>

<p>“I hated to say that,” she whispered to Polly as she stood on the
doorstep; “but I couldn’t let her go on hoping and hoping, as I was
afraid she would. I wish she could go; but Sardis, though he’s smart as
all creation, acts kind o’ foolish sometimes. I’ll let you know soon ’s
I hear. I can telephone from the grocery store.”</p>

<p>Polly was more disappointed than she at first realized. She was
indignant with this brother of the queer name. To think anybody could
be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> pig-headed as to refuse to believe what her father asserted as
truth. If it were only he that would suffer through hot August, instead
of sweet, frail little Dolly! He must be an ignorant fellow, this
Sardis. Polly said to herself that she would like to tell him what she
thought. It wouldn’t be very flattering to his judgment. She wondered
if she could induce him to be sensible if she should write herself; but
finally she decided to wait.</p>

<p>Nearly a week passed, but no word came from the little far-away New
Hampshire town to the Children’s House of Joy. At last Polly was so
anxious that two days before the morning of starting for Overlook she
drove out to Prattsboro.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edmonson had received no answer to her letter. Perhaps Sardis had
been too busy to go to the post-office, his aunt thought likely. He
lived quite a distance from the center, she said. She did not appear
to be much disturbed; but little Dolly looked whiter and wispier than
ever. Polly’s heart ached to see her.</p>

<p>“It won’t make any difference whether we hear or not,” Mrs. Edmonson
said dully. “I know Sardis well enough to know he would not do anything
about it. So don’t let it change your plans in the least. I may get a
letter to-morrow. He’ll answer&mdash;he always does.”</p>

<p>Polly drove sadly home and told her father the disappointing news.</p>

<p>He was sorry and said so. “Probably,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> added, “the child won’t live
through the summer if she stays here.”</p>

<p>Polly went back to her duties, almost wishing that she had never seen
Dolly Merrifield.</p>

<p>The next day went its hot, lagging way, and Paradise Ward prepared for
an early morning start. Polly put her little folks to bed early, and
when they were asleep she went downstairs, leaving a young nurse in
charge.</p>

<p>“No message from Prattsboro, I suppose,” she said to her mother.</p>

<p>“Not a word. It is too bad.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to give that Sardis a shaking,” said Polly grimly. “When the
dear child could be so comfortable and happy up on Overlook!”</p>

<p>The two were still talking when eleven strokes from the clock in the
next room started Polly to her feet. “And I meant to be asleep by this
time!” she laughed.</p>

<p>One of the hospital orderlies appeared at the door, an envelope in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Dr. Dudley wished me to give you this. He will be down in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>Polly took the telegram wonderingly, then opened it. “Mother!” she
cried&mdash;“listen!”</p>

<h2><a name="xiv" id="xiv"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span>PARADISE WARD ON WHEELS</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE little gray house in Prattsboro, opposite Mrs. Hamilton Garde’s
garage, saw busy hours throughout that sultry July night of Sardis
Merrifield’s message. Aunt Sophie and a kindly neighbor mended and
stitched and washed and ironed and packed, to get Dolly ready for her
journey next day and the outdoor months to follow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the little maid for whom they labored slept quietly in the
adjoining room, all unknowing of the delights in store for her.</p>

<p>The next morning at eight o’clock a little procession waited in front
of the Children’s House of Joy, making ready for its start on the long
journey to Overlook Mountain.</p>

<p>At the head stood Colonel Gresham’s seven-passenger car, in charge of
John, the Colonel’s chauffeur. Next came No. 45678; then Russell Ely,
who had placed himself and his car at Polly’s disposal; while Colonel
Gresham’s small truck, piled with all manner of luggage, tagged the
three. The children were chattering and snickering as only little
people can. There were last words to say, last bundles to dispose of,
and all was hilarity and happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
“Now, father,” said Polly, “remember that you have promised to come up
in August for a few days at the least, and you must plan to make it a
week if you possibly can. You owe it to yourself and to your patients.
I do wish you and mother could come together.”</p>

<p>She looked appealingly into Mrs. Dudley’s eyes.</p>

<p>Her mother smilingly shook her head. “I’ll try to come,” she said, “and
I’ll do my very best to make your father keep his promise; but I’m
afraid we can’t come at the same time.”</p>

<p>“When are we goin’?” piped up Timmy, flinging the query in Polly’s
direction.</p>

<p>“As soon as I can make this box stay where it belongs,” she laughed.
“There! I believe that’s positively the last.”</p>

<p>Her eyes scanned the running-board, the walk, even the roadway. Was
everything in? She paused, thinking.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to find a single package more,” laughed Lilith. “If we don’t
start pretty soon&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh! I forgot&mdash;” She dashed towards the house.</p>

<p>“What? What?” cried those nearest.</p>

<p>“Ain’t we goin’?” queried a worried little voice.</p>

<p>Russell was already leaping after Polly, while Lilith reassured the
anxious tot. In a moment the two runaways reappeared in the doorway,
Russell carrying Polly’s forgotten lunch basket.</p>

<p>This made the grown folks laugh. Then everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> said good-bye. There
was a waving of hands, the cars burr-r-ed and sizzed and smoked; there
were more good-byes and hand-wavings&mdash;and they were on the long way to
Overlook.</p>

<p>Reaching Prattsboro Polly Dudley’s car whirled ahead of the procession
and speeded around to the little gray house.</p>

<p>Dolly Merrifield was at the window, ready from hat to shoe, and even
more radiant than usual.</p>

<p>“I never was so taken back in my life,” declared Aunt Sophie, looking
up from the suitcase she was strapping. “I got a letter from Sardis
just now, telling why he didn’t answer mine. He hadn’t got it! And to
think your father should take the trouble to write! Well, if he hadn’t,
Dolly could not have gone&mdash;that’s all. I’m mighty glad he did, and we
all are. Why, Sardis says he went to the post-office and there wasn’t
any letter from me. You see, it got mixed up with somebody else’s mail,
and he hadn’t got it even then; but he’d heard about it, though. Such
doings!</p>

<p>“According to Sardis, anything your father says, goes. I didn’t know
he knew him; but it seems he’d heard all about him&mdash;when he was down
at Yale, I guess. He says he wouldn’t have Dolly miss it for anything.
Dear me, this string ain’t long enough! I’ll have to tie a piece on.
Thank you. Guess my fingers are nervous. There, that’s all! My! all
those autos going? Won’t you have a splendid time! How far’d you say it
was?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
“About a hundred and forty miles.”</p>

<p>“My!” ejaculated Mrs. Edmonson again. “Well, you’ve got a lovely day.
You’ll let me know how Dolly stood it, won’t you?” she asked a bit
anxiously as she followed the others to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>“I’ll send you word right away,” Polly reassured her. “Father says
she’ll get along all right, and we have a doctor right here, if we
should need anything. And a nurse, too,” she laughed. “They are going
to be with us all summer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they are!” exclaimed Aunt Sophie in a relieved tone. “I shall feel
easier about her, then.”</p>

<p>They had reached Polly’s car, and Russell put the little girl on the
front seat, between the driver and Lilith.</p>

<p>Aunt Sophie stepped upon the running-board and kissed Dolly again, and
then backed out to make way for Polly.</p>

<p>“I’ll write to you, Aunt Sophie,” promised Dolly. “Don’t work too hard!
And don’t forget to take a nap before you do the dishes, ’cause you
were up all night!”</p>

<p>That was a wonderful ride to most of the passengers. It was just warm
enough to be comfortable, with a fresh breeze&mdash;exactly such a morning
as Polly would have chosen.</p>

<p>“Tired, dear?” she questioned, smiling down into the little face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
“Not a bit,” Dolly smiled back. “Isn’t it splendid! Aren’t you glad
Sardis said yes? I wonder if he ever had such a nice ride.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” laughed Polly; and then, “Have you thought, dear, you
will be nearer your brother than when you were at home?”</p>

<p>Dolly’s little thin face grew pink, “O&mdash;h!” she said softly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know just where your brother is. I must look it up. He may be
right across the New Hampshire line.”</p>

<p>“He is away up in the northern part.” The pink faded. “Never mind, we
shall be nearer than when I was down in Prattsboro.”</p>

<p>The child wagged her head delightedly, while Polly wondered what kind
of brother this was to hold such a place in his little sister’s heart.
If he were all that Dolly believed him to be, she should like to know
him.</p>

<p>The wind died and the air grew warm. Jozy and Esther on the back seat
were asleep.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” Polly turned to Lilith. “We are pretty near
Springfield.”</p>

<p>“Quarter of twelve.”</p>

<p>“Almost time for dinner. We’ll be on the lookout for a shady spot.”</p>

<p>“I’m famished,” declared Lilith. “Isn’t that tree big enough?”</p>

<p>“No,” Polly laughed. “If I remember, there is a bit of shade this side
of Northampton.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
“Do hurry up, then, for I’m sure the tots are starving.”</p>

<p>“Are you hungry, dear?” Polly smiled down at Dolly.</p>

<p>“Not much.”</p>

<p>“Hear that! Where is the lunch basket?” Lilith peered down over the
back of her seat. “I believe you hid it away! I don’t see anything
familiar.”</p>

<p>Polly looked mischievous. “There are chicken sandwiches and
cream-cheese sandwiches and chocolate snaps and oranges and coffee
and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Lilith clapped her hands to her ears. “Isn’t she naughty, Dolly?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Dolly; “she couldn’t be&mdash;ever.”</p>

<p>“You see, I have a stanch champion,” Polly twinkled.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” sighed Lilith in mock distress, “everybody swears allegiance
to you. I foresee what lonesome days I am going to have up on the
mountain.”</p>

<p>Dolly was looking at the girl with a puzzled expression. Lilith’s face
was perfectly serious.</p>

<p>“I love you too,” she said sweetly.</p>

<p>“Bless her little heart!” cried Lilith. “You and I are going to have a
lovely time at Overlook, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Lilith,” answered Dolly, yet this was becoming even more
perplexing. Hadn’t she just said&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Lilith was watching her. “Did you think I was in earnest?” she smiled.
“That’s the way Polly and I amuse ourselves. I was only joking. I am
delighted to have everybody love Polly.”</p>

<p>At which the little face grew bright again.</p>

<p>“There!” exclaimed Lilith; “a tree! a tree!&mdash;it’s dinner-time!”</p>

<p>Polly speeded up the car and whizzed by the designated shrub.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say”&mdash;and the jester was serious this time&mdash;“let me out at that
little tea-room or tavern or whatever&mdash;honest, Polly, I mean it!”</p>

<p>So the car stopped, and the girl disappeared inside the door. Soon she
came out, her hands full of ice-cream cones which she served to her
fellow-passengers and then ran back for more.</p>

<p>Russell drew up beside Polly and leaped out, to follow Lilith. Dr. Abbe
was not far behind, and the three returned with more cones, running
back and forth until all were supplied.</p>

<p>It was a happy thought of Lilith’s, for the children were in ecstasies,
and the icy sweets were grateful to everybody. Dr. Abbe and Russell
lingered by Polly’s car, the children on the back seat eating and
chattering by turns. Suddenly Little Duke’s voice piped high above the
others’.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s awful hot; but My hasn’t sweat a hair!”</p>

<p>Those on the front seat laughed slyly.</p>

<p>“Pretty good,” observed Russell softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“Amusing little fellow,” returned Dr. Abbe in the same tone.</p>

<p>Polly glanced behind. Little Duke, all unconscious of the notice, was
engaged in examining his suit of new tan linen which was his especial
admiration. Finding it still immaculate, he resumed his ice-cream,
remarking, “If My should get a drop on this, it would be enough to
drive the angels to drink.”</p>

<p>Russell grinned, Dr. Abbe’s lips puckered, Lilith laughed into her
handkerchief, while Polly whirled her back towards the small boy, and
chuckled.</p>

<p>“You seem to be in a fair way to have plenty of entertainment,”
observed Russell.</p>

<p>“This goes a little ahead of our regular everyday kind,” returned
Polly; “but there’s always enough to keep us cheerful.”</p>

<p>“It is well we didn’t wait for a woodsy dining-room,” declared Polly,
when they were again racing northward. “It doesn’t look as if we’d find
one very soon.”</p>

<p>It grew hotter and hotter. Polly drove faster.</p>

<p>“There’s a lovely place this side of South Deerfield,” observed Lilith.
“We’re nearly there, I think. Tired, Dolly dear?”</p>

<p>“Some,” she answered softly, with a little wan smile.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have dinner,” cried Polly gayly, speeding her car.
“Look ahead! See that little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> wood&mdash;that’s where we’re going to stop.”
And almost as she spoke the place was reached.</p>

<p>“Oh, how beautiful!” breathed Dolly.</p>

<p>The four cars drew up on the grass beside the road, lunch boxes were
opened, and very shortly everybody was eating and drinking, the
grown-ups taking only hurried nibbles until most of the children had a
glass of milk in one hand and a chicken sandwich in the other. All felt
the refreshment of the cool, green dining-room. The young men poured
the ice-cold coffee and lemonade, the girls handed out sandwiches
and cookies, oranges and small cakes, until weariness and heat were
forgotten, and everybody was in gay morning mood.</p>

<p>There was not much to pack away into basket and box when the luncheon
was over, only a few cookies and bottles of milk, in case of need later
in the day.</p>

<p>Just as they were ready to start on again, Polly called Dr. Abbe.</p>

<p>He came as if on wings. “At your service,” he bowed.</p>

<p>“Would you mind letting Dolly go to sleep in your arms?” she asked. “I
think she will be easier there.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to take her,” was his assurance.</p>

<p>“You might change places with one or two of the children here on the
back seat,” Polly suggested, noticing the little maid’s troubled face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
“Then Dolly will be right with me when she wakes up.”</p>

<p>The exchange was quickly made, and on went the cars, on and on,
through wide farm lands, beside gurgling streams and quiet lakes. They
whirled into pretty villages and out, ran along the foot of hills and
skirted deep ravines, where down, down, down, a brook was singing. The
mountains drew closer and climbed nearer the clouds. But only the grown
people saw and enjoyed it all, for the children, to the very last one,
had fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>They had passed through Brattleboro and were following the winding
river when&mdash;bang!</p>

<p>There was an instant outcry, and everybody that was awake peered
out to discover the trouble. It was one of Russell’s tires that was
responsible for the spoiling of so many naps, and at once his coat was
off and he was getting out his tools, begging the rest to go on and
promising to follow as soon as possible. But the road was shady and the
cars came to a halt, John and Charley running to help with the injured
tire.</p>

<p>The little folks in Russell’s car were in mild excitement, watching
proceedings with great interest. The less fortunate ones, after vainly
craning their necks and being unable to get a satisfactory view of
the scene, gave themselves up to conversing with their neighbors or
finishing their interrupted naps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
“I say, it’s a good time for a lunch&mdash;” began Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh!”&mdash;“Oh, do, Miss Dudley!”&mdash;“I’m hungrier than anything!”&mdash;“What are
we goin’ to have?”&mdash;“Oh, my! are we goin’ to have ice-cream?”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have cookies and milk,” replied Polly. And she began
fishing out the cakes from a deep bag.</p>

<p>The little folks were all wide awake at once, including Dolly
Merrifield, who looked as fresh as need be.</p>

<p>Polly and Dr. Abbe walked over to the workers where John, driver of the
truck, was pumping. “It was good of you to hold Dolly all this time,”
said the girl. “Isn’t she a darling?”</p>

<p>“She is,” he answered. And then they fell to talking of the little maid
and what they hoped the outing would do for her.</p>

<p>The tire was in place, the men were putting on their coats. “Whew,
but it’s hot!” ejaculated Russell, wiping his forehead with his grimy
handkerchief. “I supposed my tires were in good con&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bang!”</p>

<p>There was a scream from Polly’s car, a series of screams, and she and
the Doctor ran ahead together. The rest came up.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened, dears! It’s only a tire.”</p>

<p>“I thought I was shot!” wailed Jozy. “So did I!” chimed in Grissel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The others laughed.</p>

<p>“Pretty big blow-out,” said Russell. He pulled off his coat that was on
only one arm.</p>

<p>Dr. Abbe regarded it ruefully. “Wish I knew how to help,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame&mdash;” began Polly.</p>

<p>“It’s fine,” returned Russell; “I’m glad to have a change from driving.
They’ve chosen a good, shady spot for it. And the tools are out&mdash;all
handy.” He ran back for them.</p>

<p>They went at the work good-humoredly, and presently the new tire was
on, and they were ready to start.</p>

<p>“Miss Dudley,” began Jozy, a little shyly, “would you mind&mdash;may&mdash;may&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” urged Polly, one foot on the running-board.</p>

<p>“May I&mdash;” Jozy began again,&mdash;“do you mind if Grissel and me sit in the
other car&mdash;the big car?”</p>

<p>“For what?” asked Polly in astonishment.</p>

<p>Jozy didn’t answer.</p>

<p>Grissel’s courage leapt forward. “We want to sit in that,” she pointed,
“so ’s&mdash;so ’s to be there when it goes off.”</p>

<p>Polly gave a little shriek of laughter, in which Dr. Abbe joined.</p>

<p>The children looked a bit shame-faced; they did not see anything funny.
Russell was only a few steps away. He turned back questioningly.</p>

<p>“Jozy and Grissel want to sit in the Gresham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> car, so as to be on the
spot when that takes its turn at popping!”</p>

<p>Russell shouted, and Jozy began to cry.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, mesdemoiselles,” smiled Russell with a low bow;
“but”&mdash;glancing at the others&mdash;“that is a good one!”</p>

<p>Grissel’s lip went up, and she hid her face in her elbow.</p>

<p>“Come, come,” coaxed Polly, “there’s nothing to cry about. We don’t
expect any more punctures, so you’d better stay where you are.” She
waved Russell off and settled herself at the wheel.</p>

<p>“What magnificent ferns!” It was Dr. Abbe’s tribute to the mountain
road.</p>

<p>“Aren’t they beautiful!” responded Lilith. “Polly says it looks as if
somebody had been decorating for a wedding.”</p>

<p>The Doctor laughed&mdash;and blushed.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he is going to be married,” thought Lilith.</p>

<p>The way wound up and up; but No. 45678 took the steep grade ascent
without flinching, and at least one of the party thought Polly managed
her car exceedingly well. As they mounted higher and still higher,
occasional breaks in the leafy roadsides drew forth exclamations of
surprise and admiration from the travelers big and little.</p>

<p>Russell drove up alongside the car ahead.</p>

<p>“Say,” he called, “this is great! Why didn’t you tell a fellow we were
bound for the clouds?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
“I thought you knew,” returned Polly. “I’m glad you like it.”</p>

<p>“Like it!” Russell took off his hat, and gazed down the valley. “It
makes a man feel pretty small,” he said.</p>

<p>Near at hand lay rolling, pine-scattered pastures, with now and then
a cultivated field or fruited orchard. Farther on, the little town of
Overlook stretched itself in a long line from the wooded north to the
open south, where shining pleasure cars ran in and out of the covered
bridge that spanned the village brook, looking like children’s toys
that could rest in the palm of one’s hand. Beyond stood the green
hills, with an occasional white farmhouse or a parti-colored bungalow,
and then range upon range of hazy mountains until they melted into the
sky.</p>

<p>On and on went the little procession, up between pines and birches and
maples, where bushes hung thick with ripening berries, and finally into
the open, leaving weather-worn farmhouses on right and left. Rocky
pastures where herds were feeding, orchards whose trees bent with
their burden of green fruit, meadows yellow with “butter and eggs” and
kingcups; these came into view and disappeared.</p>

<p>“There is the site of the old town,” said Polly, waving her hand
toward a field of tall grass on her right. “Nearly one hundred years
ago Overlook was moved down into the valley, and small stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> mark
the location of its principal buildings. See that monument over there?
That is where the court-house stood. Haven’t you noticed, along the
roadside, occasional little numbered granite stones?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I wondered what they were for,” answered Dr. Abbe.</p>

<p>“Each marks the site of some house; it tells on the monument what they
were.”</p>

<p>Everybody looked until the spot was left well behind and a bungalow
came into view.</p>

<p>“That isn’t ours,” said Polly. “We are going farther to the left. It
won’t look familiar even to me, for they are putting on a new piazza
and a sleeping-porch&mdash;unless they’ve finished them already.”</p>

<p>“I see it!” cried Lilith. “And I do believe Benedicta is out watching
for us.”</p>

<p>She was. And with outspread arms she received them all, her homely face
one big welcoming smile.</p>

<h2><a name="xv" id="xv"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span>THE FIRST DAY</span></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">A</span> HALF-DOZEN wheel-chair girls and boys were ranged along the wide
veranda, all smilingly alert to their new surroundings.</p>

<p>Polly, seated on the top step of the stairs that faced the south,
looked dreamily off to the hills&mdash;thinking of David.</p>

<p>Russell Ely came suddenly into her line of vision, and her eyes
followed him, a trim young figure in the morning sunshine.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he called presently, “come and show me the rest of it!”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” Polly answered. “Dr. Abbe will take you all over.”</p>

<p>He came nearer.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask Dr. Abbe,” he objected quietly; “I asked you.”</p>

<p>Polly smiled and moved nearer the post as he dropped to the step beside
her.</p>

<p>“I have to stay with the children,” she explained.</p>

<p>“All the time?” queried the young man.</p>

<p>“Nearly.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Don’t believe I’d like it.”</p>

<p>“It is much more satisfactory,” she returned, “than watching time all
day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Russell looked at her keenly; but her eyes still kept to the hills.</p>

<p>“Miss Dudley, what does that mean?” Grissel pointed upward, stretching
sidewise in a vain attempt to see the words over the entrance.</p>

<p>“Oh! ‘Sunrise Chalet’?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m&mdash;I mean, Miss Dudley. Clementina said it was ‘Sunrise
something’&mdash;she didn’t know what.”</p>

<p>“It is the name of the house,” Polly explained. “All the houses up here
have names or inscriptions. We’ll go to see them some day.”</p>

<p>“What do they have ’em for?” persisted Grissel. “And what does
‘shallay’ mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about it, honey,” broke in Benedicta, appearing
in the doorway. She moved a chair towards the child, and sat in it,
pulling her sleeves down and buttoning them about her wrists.</p>

<p>“You see, my Miss Flora and Mr. Aimé who live here were part Swiss and
part Scotch. Their pa was a Swiss gentleman, a descendant of the great
patriot, Mr. Arnold von Winkelried, and their ma was a Scotland girl,
and they lived in a shally in Switzerland till their pa passed over.
Then their ma, bein’ raised in Scotland, begun to hanker after the
heather&mdash;that’s a little pink flower&mdash;or sometimes white. Wal, back
she went, and it kicked up a prodigious muss with their pa’s brother,
and the joke of it is, their uncle&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> old bach, him who’s just
gone&mdash;procrastinated one day too many and passed over sudden, without
a will, and my Miss Flora and Mr. Aimé possess all that property! They
inhabited Scotland as long as their ma lived; then they came out to New
York and sojourned there until Mr. Aimé got to be a lawyer and my Miss
Flora learned to be a beautiful singer&mdash;oh, you ought to hear her! I
don’t ever expect to hear anybody sing like her till I get to heaven.
My, can’t she sing! Wal, where was I? Oh, yes! They wanted to be out in
God’s country, and they built here. They had an appalling time gettin’
somebody to do their cookin’ till I come&mdash;that was five years ago, when
my twin passed over. My twin&mdash;his name was Benedict&mdash;lived down the
mountain a piece, and after his wife was gone I resided with him and
took care of the kids. Ben was always grumpy and he kep’ sayin’ he was
going pretty quick, pretty quick, and one day I said I sh’d think he’d
try to hold on a while longer, funerals were so inordinately expensive
just then, and he said he didn’t see much use in waitin’ when anybody
felt as bad as he did. But I could see he exhilarated up a bit, and he
stayed quite a period after that. My Miss Flora and Mr. Aimé came for
me before he passed over; but I said no, I’d stay till he got through.
After a while he had a stroke, and we buried him right out front.
Maybe you saw it comin’ up.... Yes, a little brown house with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> red
barn alongside of it and the graves across the road. That’s the place.
My nephew, Young Ben, sojourns there now. I get all our milk of him.
He’s got three Guernsey cows, and they’re amazin’ healthy&mdash;sinners and
snobs! I forgot!”</p>

<p>Benedicta ran a short race with time, and won, for her voice came back
to them, “Ain’t I the lucky one! A minute more, and they’d been goners
sure!”</p>

<p>“Say!” Clementina pulled Polly’s sleeve, “Miss Dudley, when she comes
back, you shut her off! I want to talk.”</p>

<p>Polly shook her head soberly, though Russell’s eyes were dancing, and
the next moment Benedicta returned and with no word of explanation
resumed her story.</p>

<p>“Wal, let’s see, where was I? Oh, yes, to go back to my Miss Flora! One
day before they put up that shally sign over the door I was tellin’
her how I always looked up to this house soon as I got out o’ bed, for
the sun showed right here first of any locality on the mountain. You
see, this is a mite the highest situation, anyway, and it touches up
the chimney first and then the roof before it hits anywhere else, ’cept
some of the trees back. And I remember now how my Miss Flora leaped
up and clapped her hands and cried, ‘Aimé, Aimé! come here quick!’ He
was establishin’ a flower bed down there, and he came right off, and
she said, ‘I’ve got it! I’ve got it!’ ‘Got what?’ he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> asked, calm as
a violet. ‘The name&mdash;“Sunrise Chalet”! Isn’t that the very thing!’ Of
course, he said yes&mdash;he always chimed straight in with her, whatever.
And if they didn’t have it up soon as ever they could get it done! And
there it’s been ever since.”</p>

<p>“And I can’t see it!” mourned Grissel.</p>

<p>Russell sprang to his feet, but Benedicta was ahead of him. Taking the
child in her strong arms she descended the steps and faced the veranda.</p>

<p>“That looks nice,” commented the little girl, wagging her head happily.
“Now take me to see the others,” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, Grissel!” reproved Polly.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to see ’em,” she explained.</p>

<p>“That isn’t the way to ask. Besides, you are too heavy for Benedicta.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, she ain’t weightier ’n a hummin’-bird,” scorned the woman. She
was already marching off across the lawn.</p>

<p>Polly shook her head. “If she lets them impose upon her this way,” she
said in a soft tone, “she’ll have her hands full.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we follow on,” Russell suggested. “Can’t any of your kids
walk?”</p>

<p>“Some of them a short distance; but I can’t go now.”</p>

<p>“Why not? I’ll shoulder one; the rest can’t run away&mdash;that’s an
advantage.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
“Lilith will show you about,” said Polly. “Shall I call her?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he smiled politely, shaking his head; then, with a
twinkling “I can find my own way,” he picked up the girl in the next
chair and started on a run towards the invisible bungalows.</p>

<p>Going inside, Polly met Mrs. Daybill and Lilith coming downstairs.</p>

<p>“Benedicta and Russell have started on a western pilgrimage&mdash;you’d
better go, too. And do you mind taking Esther and Timmy along? It won’t
hurt them to walk as far as the Sandfords’ and the Temples’, will it?”
addressing the White Nurse.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how far that is; but a little walk will do them good.
What’s the matter with your going?”</p>

<p>“Not this morning. I’ve promised Russell to go over to Sally’s with him
after dinner.”</p>

<p>“All right for this once,” laughed Mrs. Daybill; “but it is not to be
‘You go and I’ll stay behind’ all summer, remember.”</p>

<p>It was nearly five o’clock when Polly and Russell bade good-bye to
Sally on the steps of the Robinsons’ pretty bungalow.</p>

<p>Some distance away Polly turned to look back at the inscription which
ran across the gable:</p>
